+
 Log in with your EAD account when the pop-up login box is displayed.
+
 At the print station swipe your UBC card in the card reader OR log in with your EAD (CWL.stu) username and password.
+
 How to print from Web Print (from your laptop)

+
 Printing and photocopying prices
+
 Printing and photocopying costs 7¢ a page for black and white, and 40¢ a page for colour. Be sure you select the correct setting to print or copy in colour before sending your job.
+
 More about Pay for Print

+
 Need help?
+
 If you require assistance with printing or photocopying, our staff at the Service Desk will be happy to help.
+
 Scanning
+
 The colour photocopier in the copy room can be used to scan multiple pages to store directly onto a USB drive. Please activate the copier with your UBC card or enter your CWL credentials when prompted.
+
 There is also a scanner in the Digital Media Lab. It can only scan one page single-sided at a time. The use of this scanner is limited to five pages per user. If you are scanning longer documents, or wish to scan double-sided, please use the colour photocopier's feed tray.
+
 Scanning prices
+
 Scanning from the feed tray of the colour photocopier costs 2¢ a page. For small jobs there is a free flatbed scanner in the Digital Media Lab.

 Orientation
+
 Orientation
+
 UBC's motto is
+
 Tuum Est
+
 which translates to
+
 It’s Yours
+
 . We invite you to take full ownership of your university experience and approach learning with passion and enthusiasm.
+
 As a new student, join in orientation activities to learn about all of the programs and services available to you. As a returning student, stay involved and give back by volunteering to help UBC welcome the incoming class.
+
 Jump Start
+
 New first-year students
+
 Jump Start
+
 is an academic orientation designed to introduce you to the university, your professors, and your classmates. You’ll spend time with senior peers and professors in your Faculty, make your first friends, and learn more about the UBC services available to you before classes start. UBC is working closely with public health authorities, but you can expect to participate in Jump Start in person this year.
+
 By taking part in Jump Start, you will be provided opportunities to:
+
 Make friends:
+
 Be ready to hit the ground running on your first day of class. Over the course of the week, you’ll meet other first-year students who are new to UBC just like you.
+
 Meet profs and peers:
+
 Spend time with UBC professors and current students before classes start. They’ll introduce you to their research and the academic community, and give you tips to help you successfully transition from high school student to university scholar.
+
 Learn about your new home:
+
 Find out about all the UBC services available to you, and discover more about the campus community you’ll be joining.
+
 Jump Start (Residence stream) runs from August 27, 2023 to September 1, 2023.
+
 Jump Start (Commuter stream) runs from August 30, 2023 to September 1, 2023.
+
 Learn more about Jump Start
+
 Be social and have fun

 Imagine UBC
+
 All undergraduate students
+
 Imagine UBC
+
 is a UBC-wide orientation event that replaces the first day of classes for most students. This year, Imagine UBC will be held in person on
+
 Tuesday, September 5, 2023
+
 . At Imagine UBC, you will be officially welcomed to the UBC Sauder School of Business by senior faculty leaders, participate in the UBC pep rally, meet some of your future professors and other students, and learn about clubs, resources, and involvement opportunities available across the university. You’ll receive more information about Imagine UBC later this summer, and no registration is required.
+
 Learn more about Imagine UBC
+
 Make friends for life

 Orientation is just your first step. Immerse yourself in university life through the many clubs and services offered by the AMS and CUS student societies.

 love being a UBC Sauder student!

 What will orientations look like this year?
+

 For all new-to-UBC students which includes students admitted to Year 1 and transfer students
+
 We are planning for an in-person experience in which students will be in groups with others in their cohort, participating in fun games and small group activities.
+
 Do I need to be an extrovert to be an Orientation Leader?
+
 Absolutely not. We understand that orientations can seem like a loud, outgoing event, and admittedly, there is cheering. That being said, we have many different types of students coming to UBC Sauder, and many types of Orientation Leaders. We want orientation to be welcoming to all! We are looking to hire a team that is balanced and representative of the UBC Sauder community, with all energy levels represented.
+
 How are leader hiring decisions made?
+
 Applications will be reviewed against the job description, the goals of Imagine UBC, and UBC Sauder values. Participants will be invited to a group interview, where our team will assess candidates around scenarios and general fit for the role

+
 Attend in-person Summer End Off (July 22, 2023 - encouraged)

+
 What if I'm already a Jumpstart Leader?
+
 Unfortunately, you cannot also be a UBC Sauder Orientation Leader. However, we encourage you to apply for the Spark Volunteer or Spirit Leader role!
+
 Do I have to commit to both programs (Imagine UBC and The Spark)?
+
 Yes. You will be leading your team of OL's throughout both events, and in some cases be facilitating parts of the event.
+
 Currently recruiting for:
+
 Spark Volunteers

 Course Basics
+
 What is the difference between a course and a section?
+
 A course is a unit of study covering a particular topic or group of topics, whereas a section is an individual instance of a course that is scheduled for set dates, days, and times. Each course has a subject (e.g., COMM) and a course number (e.g., 290). Many courses have multiple sections that are offered at different times. Each section has a corresponding section number (e.g., 101, 102, 103, etc.).
-Back To Top
+
+Back To Top
+
 What do the abbreviations LEC, WEB, TUT, LAB, etc. mean?
+
 These abbreviations refer to the format of a section’s meeting activity. Descriptions of common course formats can be found on the Introduction to UBC classes webpage:
+
 students.ubc.ca/new-to-ubc/introduction-ubc-classes
-Back To Top
+
+Back To Top
+
 What are prerequisites?
+
 A prerequisite is a requirement (typically a course or list of courses) that must be successfully completed prior to taking a specific course. For example, COMM 293 is a prerequisite to COMM 294 so it must be completed prior to taking COMM 294.
-Back To Top
+
+Back To Top
+
 What are co-requisites?
+
 A co-requisite is a requirement (typically a course or list of courses) that must either be taken concurrently (at the same time) or have been successfully completed prior to taking a specific course. When registering for courses that require a co-requisite, remember to also register for the co-requisite for the same term, if not already completed.
-Back To Top
+
+Back To Top
+
 What is the difference between general and restricted seats in a course?
+
 General seats in a course section are open to any students who are eligible to take the course (i.e., they satisfy all restrictions—if any—that are set at the course level). Restricted seats in a course section are open only to those students who satisfy an additional set of restrictions (e.g., enrolment in a particular year level, program, etc.). For example, the majority of seats in sections of COMM 353 are restricted to students in the Accounting option, but some sections may also include a limited number of general seats for Year 3 BCom students in other options.

+
 What is transfer credit?
+
 Transfer credit is a recognition of course work completed at another institution which is equivalent or comparable to UBC course credit. In many cases, you can use the credit you have earned at a previous institution to fulfill your BCom requirements. Read more about transfer credit at
+
 students.ubc.ca/enrolment/registration/transfer-credits
+
 If your high school studies included Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), or British-patterned education (A-Levels), you may be eligible to receive transfer credit. Learn more at
+
 mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/registration/#firstyeartransfercredit
+
 You can use a maximum of 60 credits of eligible coursework—completed at other institutions or within another program at UBC prior to your admission to the UBC Sauder School of Business—toward your BCom degree requirements. At least 50% of your program (i.e., 61 credits) must be completed while enrolled at UBC Sauder. See
+
 Requirements to Receive a Degree or Diploma
+
 in the UBC Calendar.
+
 Transfer credit is awarded at the university level rather than for a particular program. It’s possible that not all of the transfer credit you received can be applied toward the BCom program. If you have questions about how your transfer credit may apply to your degree requirements, please contact the
+
 Undergraduate Office
+
 .
+
 Note that credit minima may differ for other considerations, such as eligibility to receive and retain scholarships, to live in UBC residence, or to apply for a post-graduation work permit. Carefully review any conditions relevant to your personal circumstances to ensure your continued eligibility. Learn more:
+
 mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/registration/#courseload

 .
-Back To Top
+
+Back To Top
+
 Where can I see my transfer credit and how do I use it toward my degree?
+
 A summary of your transfer credit can be viewed on the Student Service Centre under
+
 Grades & Records
+
 >
+
 Transfer Credit
+
 . Eligible transfer credit will apply toward your degree requirements automatically. You don't need to do anything to activate or use it.

 I have transfer credit from high school. Can I use these credits toward my degree?
+
 If your high school studies included Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), or British-patterned education (A-Levels), you may be eligible to receive transfer credit that you can use toward your degree requirements. Learn more at
+
 mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/registration/#firstyeartransfercredit

+
 I have transfer credit for a required course from high school. What if I take an equivalent course at UBC? Can I use both?
+
 You cannot use credit for both courses. For example, MATH 100, MATH 110, and MATH 180 are equivalent courses. If you have transfer credit for MATH 100 and take either MATH 100 or MATH 180 at UBC, MATH 100 credit can no longer be used.
-Back To Top
+
+Back To Top
+
 What is a preclusion (PR)?
+
 If a course taken at another institution precludes any UBC course, the transfer credit cannot be used if the course is taken at UBC. For example, if COMM 1st (3) precludes COMM 101, Year 1 students who must take COMM 101 cannot use the COMM 1st credit. If a preclusion applies to an elective, the transfer credit can be used unless the elective course is taken at UBC. For example, if ECON 2nd (3) precludes ECON 345 (3), ECON 2nd can be used as elective credit, unless ECON 345 is taken at UBC.
-Back To Top
+
+Back To Top
+
 What is an exemption (EX)?
+
 An exemption is the waiving of a prerequisite or a required course. An exemption is typically granted together with a general credit, which covers the required course in the degree requirements. For example, if a student is granted an exemption from COMM 293 (0) and COMM 2nd (3), the COMM 2nd (3) credit covers the COMM 293 (3) requirement in the degree check.

+
 How many credits do I need to be registered in?
+
 Many students take a full course load of 30/31 credits during the Winter session. If you’re thinking about reducing your course load, be mindful of commitments and considerations that require you to be registered in a minimum number of credits to maintain your eligibility (e.g., loans, scholarships, housing, study permit, etc.).

 I'm a transfer student who is new to UBC Sauder. How do I figure out which courses to take?
+
 Start by reviewing your program requirements at
+
 mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/courses-money-enrolment/program-requirements/general-program-requirements
+
 Next, review your transfer credit and compare it to your program requirements. A summary of the transfer credit you have been awarded can be viewed on the Student Service Centre under
+
 Grades & Records > Transfer Credit
+
 . Eligible transfer credit will apply toward your degree requirements automatically.
+
 You can use a maximum of 60 credits of eligible coursework—completed at other institutions or within another program at UBC prior to your admission to the UBC Sauder School of Business—toward your BCom degree requirements. At least 50% of your program (i.e., 61 credits) must be completed while enrolled at UBC Sauder. See
+
 Requirements to Receive a Degree or Diploma
+
 in the UBC Calendar.

 Transfer credit is awarded at the university level rather than for a particular program. It’s possible that not all of the transfer credit you received can be applied toward the BCom program. If you have questions about how your transfer credit may apply to your degree requirements, please contact the

+
 When is registration?
+
 The registration open period for the following summer and winter sessions is typically in mid-March and mid-June through to mid-July, respectively. Registration dates for 2021S and 2021W was delayed due to the pandemic. Registration date ranges for both sessions are listed by year level at

+
 A course I want to take is full. Can I ask the instructor if I can join? Can I be added to a waitlist?
+
 If you’re unable to register in a required Commerce course that cannot be delayed to a subsequent term, you can request registration assistance through the form found at
+
 mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/regi-assist
+
 Commerce instructors cannot register you in their courses. All students will be referred to the Undergraduate Office and asked to submit a request for registration assistance if they meet at least one of the valid criteria for a request. If you do not meet any of the valid criteria, we recommend that you continue to monitor enrolment so that you can register yourself in any seats that become available.
+
 For courses other than Commerce, consult the faculty offering the course you wish to take to learn the correct procedure to request registration.
+
 If a course has a waitlist, the waitlist will be listed on the Student Service Centre as its own section. You can register for a waitlist as you would a regular course. Note that your registration in any waitlist sections will count toward your registration credit limit within the current term and session.

+Back To Top
+
 There is a restricted seat available in a course for which I’ve been trying to register. Why can’t I register for that seat?
+
 If you’re unable to register, you may not meet all of the course restrictions. First, check that you meet any restrictions at the course level (e.g.,
+
 This course is restricted to students in one of these programs: BCOM in year: >=3
+
 ). Next, confirm that you have completed any required prerequisites and that you have completed or are concurrently registered in any required co-requisites. Lastly, look at the specific seat requirements listed under
+
 Restricted Seats Remaining
+
 for that particular section. If you still have questions about your eligibility, please contact the
+
 Undergraduate Office
+
 .
-Back To Top
+
+Back To Top
+
 What can I do if I'm a Year 4 student and am unable to register for a course that I need to graduate?
+
 Needing a course to meet graduation requirements is a valid reason to request registration assistance:
+
 mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/regi-assist
+
 While we will try to accommodate your preferred section and course, it may be necessary to add you to an alternate section or course that will fulfill the same degree requirement if your requested section/course is full. Note that completion of a second option or a concentration is optional; these courses are electives that are not eligible for registration assistance.

+Back To Top
+
 My study permit is delayed. What should I do?
+
 If your study permit is delayed, then you must first review the information regarding academic concessions on your course outlines. Students who cannot join the course in-person should drop their courses no later than the
+
 add or drop a course without a W deadline
+
 to avoid any financial and/or academic penalties.
+
 If you need degree planning, please contact the UGO front desk or schedule an appointement with an Academic Advisor at
+
 mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/ugo
+
 . Students can make changes to their registration on the Student Service Centre (SSC) or request to drop courses (e.g. Term 1) from their STT by submitting the online form. Learn more about dropping courses within an STT at

 Can I increase the number of credits I’m allowed to register for?
+
 Balancing a full course load is challenging, so a credit increase is not usually recommended, particularly if you work or have other responsibilities. If you are approved for a credit increase (3-6 credits max), you will not be eligible for academic concession for any issues related to your increased workload.
+
 Credit increases are only permitted after all students have had a chance to register.
+
 Credit increases are not granted to allow for holding a spot on a waitlist.
+
 Year 1 students are not eligible for credit limit increases.
+
 The
+
 credit limit increase request form
+
 opens for the Winter session in the second week of August and again in January. If you need to request a credit limit increase for the Summer session, please email
+
 bcomquestions@sauder.ubc.ca
+
 after your Summer registration opens (check registration dates at
+
 students.ubc.ca/enrolment/registration/registration-dates
+
 ). In your email, please include your student number, the specific courses you are hoping to take in the Summer session, and why you are requesting an increase (e.g., completing remaining credits to graduate in November).
+
 Credit increase requests for the Summer session will be processed after registration has opened for all students.

 When is the deadline to add a course or drop a course once it has started?
+
 Two withdrawal deadlines are listed on the details screen for each course section on the Student Service Centre. The first deadline is the last day to withdraw without a W (withdrawal) standing on your academic transcript. This deadline is also the last day to add the course in that particular term. The second deadline is the last day to withdraw with a W standing. If you drop a course before the first withdrawal deadline, you will be eligible for a full refund of tuition for the course. If you drop a course between the first and second withdrawal deadlines, you will receive a partial or no refund of tuition depending on when you drop the course. Learn more:

 Can I drop courses from my Year 1 standard timetable (STT)?
+
 If you have transfer credit for any courses within your STT, you can request to have them dropped after you've registered (you will not be able to drop them yourself). You can request to drop these courses by completing this form before the withdrawal deadline:
+
 Request to drop STT course(s)
+
 Please review the following website for withdrawal deadlines:
+
 students.ubc.ca/enrolment/dates-deadlines
+
 students.ubc.ca/enrolment/finances/tuition-fees/tuition-refund-dates
+
 Depending on which course(s) are dropped, you may choose to take a reduced course load (that means fewer than 30 credits) or you may choose to register for additional non-Commerce electives. The choice is yours. Please review the information on the
+
 registering for courses page
+
 carefully, including the
+
 impacts of a reduced course load
+
 , before submitting your request. Once we have dropped courses from your STT, we won't be able to reregister you in them.
+
 Note that credit minima may differ for other considerations, such as eligibility to receive and retain scholarships, to live in UBC residence, or to apply for a post-graduation work permit. Carefully review any conditions relevant to your personal circumstances to ensure your continued eligibility. Learn more:

+
 Can I switch sections of courses within my Year 1 STT?
+
 Within your standard timetable, you belong to a cohort of students who share the same course schedule to provide more opportunities for connection and collaboration. You will not be able to make changes to individual sections within your STT.
+
 When you register, you are expected to choose an STT that will complement any additional courses and non-academic commitments without conflicts. Section switches within STTs will only be considered in rare cases if the reason to switch falls within the valid reasons for registration assistance as outlined at
+
 mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/regi-assist
+
 and there are general seats available in alternate sections after all students have had an opportunity to register.

+
+Back To Top
+
 Can I be added to a course after the deadline to register?
+
 No, you must register for all of your courses before the deadline to withdraw without a W standing. While UBC provides the flexibility for you to register for most courses up to two weeks after their start date, you must accept certain responsibilities when joining a course that is already underway. Some things to consider before registering:
+
 It's your responsibility to learn any material that has already been taught. This will involve self-study. While your instructor may be available during office hours to answer questions, they will not have time to re-teach all of the material that has already been discussed before you started attending the course. The onus is on you to catch up.
+
 Many courses at UBC Sauder require active participation in class. You must complete all previously assigned readings and coursework at your earliest opportunity so that you are fully prepared to contribute to class discussions and engage in group work.
+
 Some instructors discourage late registration in their courses if group work or assignments are required during the first two weeks. Talk to your instructor as soon as you join the class. They may recommend that you take their course at a later date so that you can attend classes from the start of term.
-Back To Top
+
+Back To Top
+
 I dropped a course after the deadline and have a W for it? What does this mean?
+
 Don’t be concerned about having a W standing on your transcript. It simply indicates that you withdrew from a course. Course withdrawals are not included in calculating your sessional or graduating averages. Remember though that you will not receive a full refund of your tuition past the first withdrawal deadline. Be mindful that a W may impact your eligibility for particular resources that have minimum credit requirements:

+
+Back To Top
+
 I’m planning to take some time off from my studies? What do I need to do?
+
 Be sure to drop your courses on the Student Service Centre before the first withdrawal deadline to receive a full refund of any tuition paid and avoid withdrawal standings on your academic record. Be mindful of the impact that a break in your studies will have on your eligibility for scholarships, loans, study permit, etc.:

 Be aware that if you do not take any courses during the current winter session, you must reapply to the BCom program to resume your studies. The application for re-admission must be submitted through the Student Service Centre by January 15 prior to the resumption of your studies the following September.
+
 You must complete your BCom degree requirements within six years of your original admission to the UBC Sauder School of Business.  If you plan to take the Winter Session off (Term 1 & 2) or you are graduating past the six years, we recommend you discuss your plan with an Academic Advisor in the

 Can I retake a course to get a better grade?

 We usually don’t have the capacity in Commerce courses to allow students to retake courses that they have successfully completed. If you were to repeat a course, both attempts would appear on your academic transcript. A higher grade in the second attempt would not replace the first; both grades would be listed on your transcript in the sessions that they were taken.

 Electives
+
 What’s an elective and how many do I need to take?
+
 Electives are general course requirements taken in addition to the specific core courses that all BCom students complete. The total number of elective credits you must complete will depend on which year level you entered the program (as a direct entry student in Year 1 or as a transfer student in Year 2 or Year 3) and which option you choose to complete.
+
 While you are not required to complete specific courses to fulfill elective requirements, a minimum number of your electives must be non-Commerce and at the 300 or 400-level.
+
 Determine your elective requirements at
+

+
 How do I choose which electives to take?
+
 Take some time to research the different subject areas and topics that are available to study at UBC. What you choose is up to you. Consider taking courses to:
+
 explore other areas of interest
+
 complement your choice of option or intended career path
+
 develop expertise in a specific subject area
+
 Keep in mind that you may need to complete 100/200-level prerequisites to take 300/400-level courses in some subjects so plan accordingly. Before you register for electives, check that those courses are not listed as “not-for-credit in the BCom program” in the tables found at
+
 mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/elective-requirements
+
 Note that if you are starting Year 1 in 2022W, your non-Commerce electives must include at least 3 credits in the humanities, and at least 3 credits in science or social science. Language courses are not eligible for the humanities requirement, but literature courses are.
-Back To Top

 Can any non-Commerce course count toward electives?
+
 Not necessarily. Before you register for electives, check that those courses are not listed as “not-for-credit in the BCom program” in the tables found at
+
 mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/elective-requirements
+
 Applicable 300/400-level electives can satisfy 100/200-level elective requirements, however, 100/200-level electives cannot substitute for 300/400-level electives (exceptions: FREN 222 and 223 are considered 300-level courses).
+
 Commerce courses (COMM, COHR, COEC, COMR, MGMT) cannot substitute for non-Commerce elective requirements.

 While electives are allotted at each year level within the four-year program requirements, this is just a suggested guide to help students plan their courses if they intend to take a full course load each winter session and finish within four years. Promotion to the next year level does not require completion of a minimum number of electives, however, any electives you have completed will count toward your total credits completed.

 Can I change my option after I choose it?
+
 You may be able to switch options if you have not yet completed the majority of your first option requirements—switching your option is not a backdoor to completing a double option—and the option you would like to switch to has space. Keep in mind that some options, like Finance, have cutoff averages.
+
 If you have a third-year standing you will be able to switch yourself to any option that is not already full (i.e., closed on the Student Service Centre). If you have a fourth-year standing you can add yourself to the option waitlist when it opens in July, however, be aware that third-year students who have just registered receive priority for option switches from the waitlist.

 What’s the difference between an option and a specialization? An option and a concentration?
+
 The terms option and specialization are synonymous. An option (i.e., specialization) is a required component within your BCom degree consisting of 12-18 credits of coursework within a specific area of business. A concentration is an optional set of related courses beyond your core degree and option requirements. Courses taken for a concentration count toward elective requirements.

 There you’ll find a summary of each option that includes sample jobs, required skills, and recommended resources to learn more about specific industries. You can also watch testimonials from students in each option.
+
 But don’t stop there. Attend information sessions and business club events, and talk to senior students about how they chose their option. Keep in mind that just because you choose a particular option now, it doesn’t mean that you won’t be able to pursue employment in other areas of business throughout your career.

 You may only be officially registered in one option. If you're planning to complete a second option, it's up to you to register yourself in any requirements for that option. You'll only be eligible to register in general seats for other options, if any are available. Often general seats are taken by Year 4 students who register before Year 3 students. Therefore, if you’re attempting to complete a second option you may need to extend your studies to successfully register in and complete all required courses.

+
 Can I double count courses between concentrations, options, and minors?
+
 Double counting is an allowance to use one course to fulfill two requirements. Some concentrations, options, and minors share common courses among their requirements. For example, COMM 414 Data Visualization and Business Analytics can be taken to fulfill requirements for the Global Supply Chain and Logistics Management, Marketing, or Operations and Logistics option, as well as the Business Analytics concentration.
+
 If the courses you take for a concentration overlap with the courses you take for an option or minor, you can double count a maximum of 3 credits of coursework in your degree toward both the concentration and one of either one option or one minor.
+
 Courses cannot be double counted between options. For example, if you are pursuing a double option in Marketing and Operations and Logistics, COMM 414 can be taken to fulfill requirements for one of the two options, but not both.
+
 Double counting a course does not reduce the number of courses you are required to take. You must still complete the total degree credits required for your program to complete your degree.

 Academic concession
+
 What can I do if an illness or another personal challenge/conflict is impacting my ability to attend classes and complete coursework?
+
 At UBC, we care about your wellbeing and are committed to supporting you in your academic pursuits. We recognize that sometimes unanticipated events or circumstances can affect your ability to complete your academic responsibilities.
+
 You may be eligible for an academic concession if your circumstances fall within certain categories. An academic concession is an allowance for you to make up missed coursework or an exam at a later date or by alternate means. Review the criteria for academic concession at

You must be in good standing (regular attendance, completed all coursework and midterm exams) in your course to be eligible for academic concession.
-Back To Top

+Back To Top
+
 I am a non-BCom student. How do I request an academic concession
+
 ?
+
 You should follow the academic concession request process as outlined by your home faculty advising office. Each faculty has its own process for in-term concessions and it is important for you to follow those guidelines in order for the request to be approved. The UGO will help you only if your home faculty advising office asks you to connect with your instructor regarding your request, and your instructor then asks you to contact the UGO. We anticipate that many COMM, COHR, COMR, COEC instructors will follow this process. If this is what you have been asked to do, then you can fill out the academic concession request form for BCom students. Please disregard the note that says the form is only for BCom students and submit the form for an in-term request. We will confirm with both you and the instructor that the information we receive is correct. Note that this process only applies to in-term requests. You must connect with your home faculty advising office for academic concession requests for final exams. The UGO will
+
 NOT
+
 process academic concession requests for final exams for non-BCom students.

 Exams
+
 When will the exam schedule be published?
+
 The exam schedules for the winter session will be published on the Student Service Centre in mid-October and mid-February for Term 1 and Term 2, respectively. During the summer session, the exam schedule is typically published three weeks prior to the final exam period in each term.
+
 Do not make travel arrangements or personal commitments until the exam schedule has been published or you have confirmed your final exam date with your instructor. Resulting conflicts will not merit academic concession.
-Back To Top
+
+Back To Top
+
 What is an exam hardship?
+
 An exam hardship is when you have three final exams scheduled within a 24-hour period. If the third exam falls on the 25th hour, it is not considered a hardship. For example, if the first exam is on Monday at 8:30am, the second exam is at 3:30pm, and the third exam is on Tuesday at 8:30am, there is no official hardship because the third exam starts just after the 24-hour period expires.
+
 If you face an exam hardship, you will be given an alternative exam date for the second exam. Contact the instructor of your second exam no later than one month prior to the scheduled exam date for courses in the winter session and no later than two weeks prior to the scheduled exam date for courses in the summer session. If the exam is for a Commerce course, your instructor may redirect you to the
+
 Undergraduate Office
+
 to report the hardship.

 any special rules for conduct as set out by the examiner.
+
 Suspected instances of academic misconduct will be thoroughly investigated and are subject to disciplinary measures.
+
 Please ensure that you have your digital or physical UBCcard to prove your identity, including when writing your final exams. Note that instructors have the right to deny a final exam to students who are unable to provide the required identification.

 Can I retake an exam that I've already written?
+
 No. If you start an exam, the grade earned will stand regardless of whether or not you're able to attend the entire duration of the exam or to complete it. You will not be permitted to rewrite the exam at a later date.
+
 If you are unwell or have other extenuating circumstances that will prevent you from writing an exam as scheduled, please review the academic concession policy at
+

+
 What do I do if I miss my exam?
+
 If you have extenuating circumstances that cause you to miss an exam, consult your course syllabus for any instructions provided by your instructor, AND self-report your absence to the
+
 Undergraduate Office
+
 . Note that you are expected to report your absence to the UGO by submitting an online academic concession form at your earliest convenience, but within 48 hours of the missed exam.
+
 Regardless of whether the exam you miss is for a Commerce or non-Commerce course (e.g., MATH, ECON), all BCom students are expected to complete the UBC Sauder academic concession request form found at
+
 mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/academic-concession
+
 Please note that submitting the form does not mean that your request for a concession will be granted. You must be in good standing (regular attendance, completed all coursework and midterm exams) in your course to be eligible for an academic concession.
+
 If you start an exam, the grade earned will stand regardless of whether or not you're able to attend the entire duration of the exam or to complete it. You will not be permitted to rewrite the exam at a later date.

+
 What do I do if I experienced technical issues during an online exam that prevented me from completing it?
+
 If you experience unresolvable technical issues during an online exam that prevent you from completing it, please follow the instructions provided by your instructor.  As soon as possible, email a detailed summary of your experience during the exam to
+
 bcomquestions@sauder.ubc.ca
+
 . Include the nature of the technical issues you encountered, when they happened, and what steps you took to attempt to resolve them. If you were in contact with any form of technical support per the instructions provided by your professor, include this in your summary as well. Each situation will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, however, there are no guarantees that any form of academic concession will be granted.

+
 I’ve been granted Deferred Standing (SD). When will my deferred exam be scheduled?
+
 If you’ve been granted a Deferred Standing (SD) for a missed final exam, you’ll normally be expected to write the exam during the official deferred exam period set by Enrolment Services unless otherwise indicated by your instructor. While some instructors may be able to offer you an earlier opportunity to take a deferred exam, they are under no obligation to do so.
+
 The deferred exam period is in late July for courses taken during the previous winter session (September to April) and in November of courses taken during the previous summer session (May to August). Exam dates and times will be scheduled by Enrolment Services (not the Undergraduate Office).
+
 Note that some course instructors set alternate exam dates that differ from the official deferred exam period (for example, COMM 393 deferred exams must be written with the next offering of the course—refer to
+
 Exceptions
+
 on the
+
 Standing Deferred and Supplemental exams page of the Student Services website
+
 ). For non-Commerce courses, contact your instructor immediately to find out if an earlier exam sitting will be offered and how to register for it.
+

+
 Grades
+
 When will my grades be available after I have completed a course?
+
 Your final official grades will be released on the Student Service Centre beginning the day after the last day of exams. There may be a delay in posting your final grade if your final exam for the course was held late in the exam period.
-Back To Top
+
+Back To Top
+
 Are there minimum grade requirements in courses?
+
 Most of your courses require a minimum grade of 50% to successfully complete them. There are a few notable exceptions. You must achieve a 60% in both ENGL 112/WRDS 150B (or equivalent course) and COMM 396 (formerly COMM 390) to satisfy these BCom degree requirements. If you are starting Year 1 in 2022W, you must achieve a 60% in both COMM 196 and COMM 396 to satisfy these BCom degree requirements.
-Back To Top
+
+Back To Top
+
 How will my academic performance for the year be evaluated?
+
 Each year during the month of May, the Undergraduate Office reviews your academic progress and calculates your winter session average based on all courses taken from September to April to determine if you have successfully completed:
+
 continuation requirements to remain in the program
+
 course requirements for promotion to the next year level
+
 This is a weighted average, taking course credit values into consideration, and does include any failing grades. If you participate in a study abroad and exchange program during the winter session, grades earned on exchange will be included in the calculation. Courses taken during the summer session (May to August) are not included in the winter session average.
-Back To Top
+
+Back To Top
+
 If I am asked to discontinue from the program because of my academic performance, can I appeal the decision?
+
 If you did not achieve the minimum 60% winter session average required to continue in the BCom program, you may request that your circumstances be evaluated on their own merits by submitting a letter of appeal to the UBC Sauder Undergraduate Office. Learn more at
+

 What is the Dean’s Honour Roll?

 After you graduate from the BCom program you can apply to take eligible UBC courses as an unclassified student. Because there is excess demand for Commerce courses from students who are still completing their BCom degree requirements, we are not able to accommodate registration requests from unclassified students for most Commerce courses.

+
 Calendly Privacy Statement

 UBC uses Calendly, an online appointment scheduling application provided by Calendly LLC and hosted on servers located outside of Canada (specifically, in the US), to enable current and prospective students to schedule academic advising appointments and discussions. UBC collects some of your personal information (name, e-mail address, and requested discussion topic) in order to schedule an appointment with an appropriate advisor. UBC collects this information under the authority of section 26(c) of BC's Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA).
+
 UBC requires you consent to disclose your personal information to Calendly and to store and access this information outside of Canada in order to provide you access to Calendly's services.
+
 By clicking the "Schedule Event" button, you are granting your consent for your personal information to be disclosed by UBC to Calendly and for that information to be stored and accessed outside of Canada.
+

 Academic concession
+
 We care about your wellbeing and are committed to supporting you in your academic pursuits. We recognize that sometimes unanticipated events or circumstances can affect your ability to complete your academic responsibilities.
+
 You may be eligible for academic concession if your circumstances fall within certain categories. An academic concession is an allowance for you to make up missed coursework or an exam at a later date or by alternate means. Carefully review UBC's academic concession policy to understand the different types of concessions as well as how to submit a request.
+
 Request academic concession

+
 Request degree credit check
+
 Proof of enrolment and confirmation of program completion letters
+
 Your UBC transcript and diploma are official documents issued by the university to affirm your academic record and completion of degree program, respectively.
+
 On occasion, you may be asked by a third-party to provide additional documentation regarding your studies at UBC, such as when applying to extend your study permit or proving your credentials to a potential employer. This is typically provided in the form of a letter from the school which may, for example, confirm:
+
 your status as a registered, full-time student
+
 your expected program completion date
+
 your completion of degree requirements
+
 conferral of your degree
+
 You can download some of these letters on demand from the Student Service Centre (SSC), but others must be requested from the UGO.
+
 Request a letter
+
 Registration assistance
+
 Please complete our registration assistance form if you need assistance to register for a required Commerce course. Our office will only process forms for which you provide a valid reason:
+
 unable to register in a standard timetable
+
 scheduling conflict between two or more required Commerce courses
+
 a required Commerce course is full (and you need it for promotion/graduation within the current session)
+
 Varsity athletic commitments
+
 Employment commitments, instructor and schedule preferences, courses required for a second option, and courses to fulfill requirements for a post-graduate program or credential such as CPA or CFA are not valid reasons to request registration assistance. Requests for these reasons will be dismissed.
+
 Commerce instructors cannot add you to their classes; they will refer all requests to our office. Academic advisors will direct all requests to the registration assistance form.
+
 Our office will attempt to accommodate your request based on seat availability in sections (not necessarily section preference), and in some cases seat availability in alternate courses that will fulfill the same requirement. Please allow at least three business days for processing.
+
 Request registration assistance
+
 Credit limit increase
+
 Balancing a full course load is challenging, so a credit increase is not usually recommended, particularly if you work or have other responsibilities. If you are approved for a credit increase (3-6 credits max), you will not be eligible for academic concession for any issues related to your increased workload.
+
 Credit increases are only permitted after all students have had a chance to register.
+
 Credit increases are not granted to allow for holding a spot on a waitlist.
+
 Year 1 students are not eligible for credit limit increases.
+
 The deadline has passed. Requests for credit limit increases are closed for 2023W Term 1.
+
 Drop STT courses
+
 If you have transfer credit for any courses within your STT, you can request to have them dropped after you've registered (you will not be able to drop them yourself). Depending on which course(s) are dropped, you may choose to take a reduced course load (that means fewer than 30 credits) or you may choose to register for additional non-Commerce electives. The choice is yours. Please review the information on the
+
 Registering for courses
+
 page
+
 carefully, including the
+
 impacts of a reduced course load
+
 , before submitting your request. Once we have dropped courses from your STT, we won't be able to reregister you in them.
+
 The deadline has passed. Requests to drop a course from a Standard Time Table (STT) are closed for 2023W Term 1.

 Group work rooms
+
 The Canaccord Learning Commons has 16 groupwork rooms available to all UBC Sauder students. Our large rooms (six to eight person capacity) come equipped with a whiteboard and a digital screen. Our small rooms (two to three person capacity) located on the main level have a white board only. Whiteboard markers and erasers, as well as laptops and mac adapters for the screens, are
+
 available for loan at the Service Desk
+
 . These rooms are meant for academic purposes and should not be used for individual study, TA office hours, or club administration.
+
 The Birmingham Undergraduate Centre, located on the first floor of the Henry Angus Building provides additional rooms for groupwork. There are also several more groupwork rooms located on the fourth floor of the Henry Angus building.
+
 Communal and silent study
+
 The Learning Commons offers a variety of options for individual and group study. Communal tables where quiet conversation is permitted are available on the main floor for individuals and small groups. Both the main and upper floors feature Silent Study areas. Study carrels are available on the upper floor, and all come equipped with a plug for electronics.
+
 Computer workstations
+
 Computer terminals and printers are available in the main area of the main and upper level. Additionally, there is a small computer lab on the main level (adjacent to Silent Study) with more computers, access to datastream and Capital IQ, and a Bloomberg terminal.
+
 Reminders
+
 As common courtesy to your fellow students and UBC Sauder staff, please ensure you pick up after yourself, and leave the room clean and tidy.
 
 No hot food is allowed anywhere in the Learning Commons. Furniture should not be removed from any room.
+
 Need a quiet space for a group work meeting or study session?
+
 Visit the UBC Sauder Room Bookings site to reserve a room. Bookings are limited to two hours in length. To ensure wide access, individuals and groups may only make one booking per day. Rooms may only be used for academic purposes, organizations and student clubs should find alternate meeting space.

+
 COMM 489 - Applied Methods in Technology Start-ups at CDL (formerly COMM 486W)
+
 COMM 489, Applied Methods in Technology Start-ups at Creative Destruction Lab is a 3-credit course in entrepreneurship in which students will work with the Creative Destruction Lab Vancouver team to support emerging technology and science focused start-ups and oversee the UBC Sauder CDL Venture Capital Program “SCVCP ” and make investment decisions allocating investment dollars into CDL ventures. Students will become familiar with the CDL-Vancouver companies and will have the opportunity to work on market analysis, customer development, financial analysis, and other core activities related to building early stage start-ups. Students will be provided with visibility into how venture capitalists and angel investors make investment decisions guided by local ecosystem venture capitalists. This course can be used toward
+
 Year 4 Entrepreneurship option requirements.
+
 We recommend that you learn more about the CDL program by visiting

+
 Summary overview
+
 CDL-Vancouver is an expansion from the original Creative Destruction Lab at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, a program that has created more than $5.0 Billion in equity value in eight years targeting companies that have the potential to transform our social, industrial, and economic landscape. The CDL is one of the world’s premier seed stage programs for massively scalable science-based ventures. Notable graduates include:
+
 Atomwise
+
 ,
+
 Notch Therapeutics
+
 ,
+
 Plantible Foods
+
 ,
+
 Ionomr Innovations
+
 ,
+
 Shift
+
 ,
+
 Spiderwort
+
 and others.
+
 The goal of the course is to provide students with knowledge and hands-on experience helping build high potential venture-scale start-ups based on a solid foundation of technology and/or science and engineering. Students will become familiar with the CDL-Vancouver companies and will have the opportunity to support them with market analysis, customer development, financial analysis, and other core activities related to building early stage start-ups. Students will also get some insight in how angel investors (and VCs) make investment decisions. Indeed, the work students do for ventures will be seen by the mentors/investors in the CDL program, and influence their investment decisions and the progress of the ventures. Some of the students across the CDL network have joined venture-backed CDL companies in key roles – this course is a unique opportunity for students who are interested in real world exposure to start-ups and seed funding.

+
 How will this course be taught?
+
 This course is a combination of both lecture and workshop sessions in which students will advance their CDL-Vancouver ventures. Workshops will draw upon knowledge from entrepreneurship and start-up best practices across many verticals and students will be coached by guest speakers such as venture capitalists, lawyers, project managers, and marketing professionals. Projects and assignments will be conducted for the benefit of the CDL ventures and students alike.

+
 The Course

+
 Click here to view the 2022W course syllabus.
+
 COMM 483 is designed to be a transformative and personal experience. It is a leadership course modeled after Harvard's first year MBA program and led by Professor Adel Gamar.
+
 In this course, leadership is viewed not as a position but an art that is accessible to anyone committed to developing and refining their practice. Learning is a vital component to the art and practice of leadership. It is a noble path that demands integrity, collaboration, and empathy. To inculcate a learning environment, students forge a community bound by collective trust while ensuring psychological safety for everyone.
+
 Through case studies, class discussions, and guest speakers, students grapple with complex challenges that include business, management, policy, and strategy. The course covers a wide range of topics and will be balanced with student experiences and interests reflected in the diverse cohort that this course attracts.
+
 This course aims to help prepare students for the challenges of leadership in an adaptive, interconnected, and inclusive world. Guest speakers included Senator Mobina Jaffer, Roger Dall'Antonia (CEO of FortisBC Inc.), Tamara Vrooman (CEO of YVR), and Carolina Larriera (former UN Diplomat).
+
 COMM 483 is worth six credits and is taught over six weekends in Term 2. Over the term, students will be required to analyze approximately 30 cases, write a 10-page self-reflective essay, complete 4-5 group assignments, stay up-to-date with current events, and actively participate in the class discussions. The summer before, you will also be required to complete various readings on leadership. There is an active social aspect and deep collegial connection to the course.
+
 The Students
+
 The true value of the course comes from the students who take part in it. We are looking for the most imaginative, ambitious, hardworking people who will be in their third year or above in Term 2 of the 2023 Winter Session (January to April 2024).
+
 Students who believe they offer something 'different' are encouraged to apply.
+
 Note: COMM 483 has a heavy course load. We encourage you seek out alumni and ask them about the course.
+

 COMM 466 - New Venture Design
+
 COMM 466 - New Venture Design
+
 Jointly offered by the Faculties of Applied Science and the UBC Sauder School of Business, and
+
 now open to students from all faculties
+
 , the goal of the course is to provide students with knowledge and experience related to the formation of entrepreneurial enterprises based on the development of a new product or process.
+
 This course has been endowed with a financial gift from Dr. Ken Spencer that provides funds for student teams to develop their product or process and compete at business plan and engineering competitions. New Venture Design student teams have gained recognition and won prizes in each of the last several years. Teams have seen success in competitions including CBC’s
+
 Dragon’s Den
+
 , New Ventures BC, Lee Kuan Yew Global Business Plan Competition in Singapore, and Queens University to name a few. The main benefits of these competitions however is to gain experiences, find mentors, and build contacts.
+
 During the course, teams of five or six students will propose one or more products, then evaluate the products based on their potential market, their estimated manufacturing and distribution costs, and other factors. The output from the course will be the development of a business plan for a proposed new enterprise, and the demonstration of a prototype of the product. Commerce students will primarily lead the business plan development, and students in engineering will primarily lead the prototype development. For example, the product can be a new physical device, a new software product, or a new engineering process. Lectures in the course will address creativity, market definition, financial projections, the design cycle, product marketing, manufacturing, distribution, support and repair.
+
 This course is open to students who will have 4th-year status by January 2024. Admission to COMM 466 (cross-listed with APSC 486) is by application only. Visit
+
 nvd.ubc.ca
+
 for instructions on how to apply. Applications for the 2023-24 Winter Session are due by
+
 11:59pm PT May 22, 2023
+
 (extended deadline). Students completing the Entrepreneurship option must submit an application for admission if they wish to take the course.
+

 Dual Degree Program Option: UBC M.B.A./Yale M.A.M.
+
 Dual Degree Program Option: UBC M.B.A./Yale M.A.M.
+
 This distinctive dual degree program option offers qualified students the opportunity to earn, in less than two years, a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) degree from UBC and a Master of Advanced Management (M.A.M.) degree from Yale University. Taken separately, both degrees would take two years and nine months to complete. The dual degree program option makes it possible to earn both degrees in one year and nine months of study by allowing students to be enrolled continuously through this period and by allowing students to earn 13 credits towards both degrees simultaneously. The Yale M.A.M. is a nine-month degree program, open only to graduates of business schools that are members of the Global Network for Advanced Management.
+
 In order to receive both degrees students must fulfill the individual program requirements for each institution's degree. Students in the dual degree program option are first admitted into the UBC M.B.A. For the UBC M.B.A., students are required to complete 50 credits, of which the first 37 credits are earned prior to the student beginning the Yale M.A.M. and the final 13 credits (final semester) are completed at Yale as part of the M.A.M. program. Students will complete the full nine months of the Yale M.A.M. degree-in-residence at Yale approximately 12 months following the start of the UBC M.B.A.
+
 Students will apply to each program separately. The M.B.A. program application will be administered by UBC, and the M.A.M. program application will be administered by Yale University. Applicants to the program must meet the approved admission requirements in place at each institution and program, including evidence of academic achievement and intellectual readiness.
+
 Enrolment is possible through one of two routes:
+
 Route 1: Candidates may be admitted to the M.B.A. at UBC's Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration (also known as the Sauder School of Business) and to the Yale M.A.M. component, prior to starting the M.B.A. component. Upon meeting UBC's continuation requirements during the first year of the M.B.A. program, students are eligible to join the M.A.M. component in year 2.
+
 Route 2: UBC M.B.A. students, who apply to the Yale M.A.M. during the first year of study in the M.B.A., may be admitted into the Yale M.A.M. component in year 2 upon meeting UBC's continuation requirements during the first year of the M.B.A. program.
-Degree Requirements
+
+Degree Requirements
+
 For the M.B.A. and M.A.M. dual degree program option with Yale, students are required to complete a minimum of 50 credits to qualify for the M.B.A. component and 40 Yale credits for the M.A.M. component. The 50 credits required for the M.B.A. component comprise one year of coursework (37 UBC credits) completed at the Sauder School of Business and 13 credits completed at Yale University. The 40 credits required to qualify for the M.A.M. component comprise nine months of coursework at Yale University; 13 of these 40 credits are also counted toward the UBC M.B.A.
+
 Each institution manages its own degree requirements.
+
 Students must meet each institution's admission and continuation requirements; however, only those credits administered by the specific institution will apply towards that institution's continuation policies.
+
 Graduation
+
 Students will graduate from each institution when they complete the program requirements of that institution. Students may attend the convocation ceremonies of both institutions. The student will receive two parchments:
+
 UBC, Master of Business Administration; and
+
 Yale, Master of Advanced Management
+

 Diploma in Accounting Program
+
 Diploma in Accounting Program
+
 Professional accounting is a respected career path that offers stimulating work, generous compensation and numerous opportunities for growth and advancement. The post-baccalaureate UBC Sauder Diploma in Accounting Program (DAP) bridges the gap for non-accounting degree graduates aspiring to earn a professional accounting designation, but lacking the prerequisite courses, to transition to a new career.
+
 DAP offers all prerequisite courses required for entry into the Chartered Professional Accountants (CPA) Professional Education Program (PEP). By combining the Diploma in Accounting with the knowledge gained through previous university studies, DAP graduates can create a leverageable career advantage.
+

 Diploma Requirements

 The DAP curriculum consists of 15 courses, 45 credits in total, which cover the theoretical and practical knowledge and skills required to excel in a career in accounting and business. In addition, the program develops enabling competencies in critical thinking, analytical problem solving, communication, and technical skills necessary to be effective in an accounting role.
+
 The program requires the equivalent of 16 months’ full-time study and offers classes in variety of delivery formats: in-person evenings and weekend classes, online, and blended which combines both in-person and online components. Working students have the flexibility to take the program part time and have up to 24 months to complete their courses.
+
 Students can enrol in a maximum of 5 courses per winter term and 3 courses per summer term. Optional elective courses allow students to satisfy the specific requirements of the professional accounting designation programs.

 The Quantitative Methods (QM) Preparation Course

 The demanding nature of the Program requires that students have an adequate understanding of business statistics, quantitative decision-making methods, time value of money concepts, economic issues and decision-making, and business computing. For individuals who have not completed prior economic and statistics coursework, participation in the QM Preparation Course is recommended. It is also an option for individuals wanting to brush up on their skills and improve the ability to perform in an accounting or business decision-making context.

 Dual Degree Program Option: J.D./M.B.A.
+
 Dual Degree Program Option: J.D./M.B.A.
+
 All the requirements of the J.D. and M.B.A. programs apply to students in the dual degree program option, except that 6 credits of Law courses are included as elective credits toward the completion of the M.B.A. program, and 6 credits of M.B.A. courses are included as elective credits towards completion of the J.D. program. Consequently, a student in the dual degree program option completes all J.D. requirements, less 6 credits, and all M.B.A requirements, less 6 credits.
+
 Students in the dual degree program option follow a program of study as outlined below:
+
 Year 1
+
 First Year J.D. Curriculum
+
 Year 2
+
 First Year M.B.A. Curriculum
+
 Years 3 and 4
+
 Remaining J.D. and M.B.A. courses as required by each program (less 6 credits for each)
+
 The total minimum credits to be taken is 130.
+
 A student's program of courses must be approved by the Assistant Dean, Students, in the Allard School of Law, and by the Assistant Dean, Robert H. Lee Graduate School, Sauder School of Business.
+
 Special Requirements
+
 1. Six J.D. credits are counted as the maximum of non-M.B.A. senior undergraduate courses normally permitted under the M.B.A. course requirements. Six M.B.A credits are counted as the maximum non-J.D. courses permitted under the J.D. course requirements. Accordingly, students will not be permitted to apply to their degrees non-M.B.A. and non-J.D. credits beyond those six J.D. and six M.B.A. credits.
+
 2. Law 407 (Taxation) must be taken. If the student has already received credit for COMM 355 (Income Taxation) or its equivalent, another 4 credits of J.D. courses must be taken in substitution for Law 407. COMM 355 will be deemed equivalent to LAW 407 for prerequisite purposes.
+
 3. A minimum of 20 credits of elective law courses must be chosen from a set of courses in the corporate, commercial, or taxation areas approved from year to year by the Assistant Dean, Students.
+
 A student's program of courses must be approved by the Assistant Dean, Students, in the Allard School of Law, and by the Assistant Dean, Robert H. Lee Graduate School, Sauder School of Business.
+
 Special Arrangements
+
 Subject to the approval of the Assistant Dean, Robert H. Lee Graduate School, Sauder School of Business, and the Assistant Dean, Students, Law, the first years of the J.D. and M.B.A. program may be exchanged upon petition.
+
 Promotion Requirements
+
 Continuance in the J.D./M.B.A. dual degree program option is conditional upon achieving a high standard of performance as determined in an annual review by the Assistant Dean, Robert H. Lee Graduate School, Sauder School of Business, and the Assistant Dean, Students, Law. A student may be permitted to complete either an M.B.A. or J.D. alone.
+
 Conferring of Degrees
+
 The M.B.A. and J.D. will be conferred at the completion of the dual degree program option after all requirements for both degrees have been met. Students who choose to receive either the M.B.A. or the J.D. prior to completion of the dual degree program option may apply for one of the degrees provided all requirements for that degree have been satisfied. Students selecting this option must simultaneously withdraw from the dual degree program option.

Applicants not given offers for the dual degree option will be evaluated for admission to each program separately.
+

 Completion of the MBA MBAN dual degree program requires 71.5 credits of coursework completed over 2 years of full-time study.
+
 MBA advanced (non-foundational) credits can be completed from courses offered in the MBA program, the Professional MBA program, the International MBA Program, and selected global learning opportunities offered by the Robert H. Lee Graduate School. Each student’s coursework must be approved by the Program Directors. A complete list of the courses required for successful completion may be obtained from the School.
+
 Special Arrangements
+

 Master of Management
+
 The Master of Management (MM) provides a professional course of study designed to prepare graduates with applied knowledge focused in business.
+
 The Master of Management is a general management program with two offerings:
+
 A 9-month program requiring a bachelor’s degree in an area other than business prior to entering the program.
+
 A 6-month program combining an undergraduate degree with the Master of Management. Please see the
+
 Undergraduate Program-Master of Management Dual Degree Option
+
 entry for details.
+
 Admission Requirements for 9-month program
+
 Admission requirements for the Master of Management Dual Degree option can be found in the
+
 UG-MM Dual Degree Option
+
 entry.
+
 Admission to the MM program is competitive and takes into consideration a variety of criteria: previous academic performance, GMAT/GRE test scores, professional experience, maturity, and fit.
+
 Applicants must hold an undergraduate degree with a minimum overall B+ average or 76% or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution. Admission to the program is competitive and generally requires an academic standing higher than the published minimum. Applicants with business degrees (majors/minors), or equivalents are NOT eligible for admission. If the applicant has sufficient professional experience or presents sufficiently high GMAT/GRE scores, a lower average may be accepted, subject to approval of the Director of the Robert H. Lee Graduate School.
+
 Applicants must hold the equivalent of a four-year bachelor’s degree. Three-year bachelor’s degrees are accepted from Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and Europe. Additional details on acceptable international credentials are available
+
 here
+
 . Applicants must present minimum GMAT or GRE score:
+
 550 GMAT with at least a 50th percentile in the quantitative and verbal sections of the test; or
+
 155 GRE score on each of the verbal and quantitative sections.
+
 Applicants from a university outside Canada in which English is not the primary language of instruction must present evidence of English language proficiency prior to admission. Tests must have been taken within the last 24 months at the time of submission of your application. Acceptable English language proficiency tests for the MM are:
+
 TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language): 100 (Internet version)
+
 IELTS (International English Language Testing Service): minimum overall band score of 7.0 with no component score less than 6.0
+
 MELAB (Michigan English Language Assessment Battery): minimum overall score of 84
+
 PTE (Pearson Test of English - Academic): minimum overall score of 70
+
 CAEL (Canadian Academic English Language Test) minimum overall score of 70
+
 Applicants with more than two years’ full-time work experience after Undergraduate Graduation are not eligible for admission. Evaluation for admission is be based on academic records, Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) scores, full-time work experience, essays, & letters of recommendation. Applicants being seriously considered for admission will be contacted by the Robert H. Lee Graduate School for an interview either in person or by Skype or phone. A list of required application documents and further information is available on the program website.
+
 Upon accepting an offer of admission to the MM Program, students will be required to pay a non-refundable deposit, which is applied to the first installment of tuition fees.
+
 Program Requirements

 The program includes a minimum of 36 credits of coursework over 9 months, as follows:
+
 Mandatory Orientation
+
 12 credits of Foundational courses
+
 3 credits of Integration courses
+
 19.5 credits of Advanced courses

 Master of Business Analytics
+
 The Master of Business Analytics (MBAN) provides a professional course of study designed to prepare graduates with the skills to apply advanced analytical tools and methods to address management challenges in today’s big data business environment.
+
 The program is available for full-time study. The program will generally be completed within 12 months of full-time study.
+
 Admission Requirements
+
 Admission to the MBAN program is competitive and takes into consideration a variety of criteria: previous academic performance, GMAT/GRE test scores, professional experience, maturity, and fit.
+
 Applicants must hold an undergraduate degree with a minimum overall B+ average or 76% or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution. Admission to the program is competitive and generally requires an academic standing higher than the published minimum. If the applicant has sufficient professional experience or presents sufficiently high GMAT/GRE scores, a lower average may be accepted, subject to approval of the Director of the Robert H. Lee Graduate School.
+
 Applicants must hold the equivalent of a four-year bachelor’s degree. Three-year bachelor’s degrees are accepted from Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and Europe. Additional details on acceptable international credentials are available
+
 here
+
 .
+
 Applicants must present the minimum GMAT or GRE score:
+
 550 GMAT with at least a 50th percentile in the quantitative and verbal sections of the test; or
+
 155 GRE score on each of the verbal and quantitative sections.
+
 Applicants from a university outside Canada in which English is not the primary language of instruction must present evidence of English language proficiency. Tests must have been taken within the last 24 months at the time of submission of your application. Acceptable English language proficiency tests for the MBAN are:
+
 TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language): 100 (Internet version)
+
 IELTS (International English Language Testing Service): minimum overall band score of 7.0 with no component score less than 6.0
+
 MELAB (Michigan English Language Assessment Battery): minimum overall score of 84
+
 PTE (Pearson Test of English - Academic): minimum overall score of 70
+
 CAEL (Canadian Academic English Language Test) minimum overall score of 70
+
 Due to the rigorous nature of the program, it is strongly recommended that applicants have some exposure to university-level courses in topics such as statistics, calculus, and linear algebra (or other courses in mathematics and statistics). Experience in computer programming, data analytics or mathematical modeling is also an asset.
+
 Evaluation for admission is be based on academic records, Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) scores, full-time work experience, essays, & letters of recommendation. Applicants being seriously considered for admission will be contacted by the Robert H. Lee Graduate School for an interview either in person or by Skype or phone.
+
 Upon accepting an offer of admission to the MBAN program, students will be required to pay a non-refundable deposit, which is applied to the first installment of tuition fees.
+
 Program Requirements
+
 Completion of the MBAN program requires 36 credits of course work completed over 12 months of full-time study. This includes:
+
 Mandatory Orientation
+
 12 credits of Foundational courses
+
 1.5 credits of Career Development
+
 19.5 credits of Advanced courses
+
 3-credit Analytics Consulting Internship
+
 Each student’s coursework must be approved by the Robert H. Lee Graduate School. A complete list of the courses required for successful completion may be obtained from the Robert H. Lee Graduate School.

 Professional Master of Business Administration

 The Professional Master of Business Administration (PMBA) is a part time program intended for students who expect to continue their professional employment during the completion of the program. The PMBA is designed to prepare graduates to analyze problems, to make decisions, and to manage, motivate, and lead people and organizations. Courses are primarily delivered on weekends. In addition to regular courses there are three 8-day in-person professional residencies.
+
 Admission Requirements
+
 Admission to the Professional MBA Program is competitive and takes into consideration a variety of criteria: previous academic performance, GMAT/GRE test scores, professional experience, maturity, and fit.
+
 Applicants must hold an undergraduate degree with a minimum overall B+ average or 76% or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution. Admission to the program is competitive and generally requires an academic standing higher than the published minimum. If the applicant has sufficient professional experience or presents sufficiently high GMAT/GRE scores, a lower average may be accepted, subject to approval of the Director of the Robert H. Lee Graduate School.
+
 Applicants must hold the equivalent of a four-year bachelor’s degree. Three-year bachelor’s degrees are accepted from Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and Europe. Additional details on acceptable international credentials are available
+
 here
+
 .
+
 Applicants must present minimum GMAT or GRE score:
+
 550 GMAT with at least a 50th percentile in the quantitative and verbal sections of the test; or
+
 155 GRE score on each of the verbal and quantitative sections.
+
 Applicants from a university outside Canada in which English is not the primary language of instruction must present evidence of English language proficiency. Tests must have been taken within the last 24 months at the time of submission of your application. Acceptable English language proficiency tests for the PMBA are:
+
 TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language): 100 (Internet version)
+
 IELTS (International English Language Testing Service): minimum overall band score of 7.0 with no other component score less than 6.0
+
 MELAB (Michigan English Language Assessment Battery): minimum overall score of 84
+
 PTE (Pearson Test of English - Academic): minimum overall score of 70
+
 CAEL (Canadian Academic English Language Test) minimum overall score of 70
+
 Applicants must present a minimum of 2 years of full-time work experience gained after graduation from the bachelor’s degree.
+
 Evaluation for admission is based on academic records, Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) scores, full-time work experience, essays, & letters of recommendation. Applicants being seriously considered for admission will be contacted by the Robert H. Lee Graduate School for an interview either in person or by Skype or phone.
+
 Upon accepting an offer of admission to the Professional MBA Program, students will be required to pay a non-refundable deposit, which is applied to the first installment of tuition fees.
+
 Program Requirements
+
 Completion of the PMBA program requires 42 credits of course work completed over 24 months. This includes:
+
 Mandatory Orientation
+
 13.5 credits of Foundational courses
+
 15 credits of Professional Residencies. Three 8-day in-person mandatory residencies, each valued at 5 credits.
+
 13.5 credits of Advanced courses
+
 In year 2 of the program, advanced courses can be completed from courses offered in the PMBA program, the MBA program, the International MBA Program, and selected global learning opportunities offered by the Robert H. Lee Graduate School. Each student’s coursework must be approved by the Robert H. Lee Graduate School office. A complete list of the courses required for successful completion may be obtained from the Robert H. Lee Graduate School.
+
 Each PMBA student is paired with a Career Coach from the Hari B. Varshney Business Career Centre, who meets regularly with the student throughout the program to help clarify and achieve career goals.

 A variety of short summer study abroad programs and global opportunities via
+
 Global Network for Advanced Management

 1.2 Passing Grade (60% and above)
+
 A minimum grade of 60% must be achieved in a course in order to receive credit towards a master’s degree. This minimum applies to both required and elective courses.
+
 1.3 Minimal Pass Grade (60 – 67%)
+
 A grade of C or C+ (between 60 and 67%, inclusive) is a minimal pass in a course. A maximum of 6 credits of minimal pass grades can be counted towards a master’s degree.
+
 1.4 Failing Grade (Below 60%)
+
 (a) Any grade below 60% is a Fail (F). If a required course is failed, it must be repeated (it cannot be replaced with a substitute course). A failed elective course may be replaced with a substitute course. Students with a failed course should review their program requirements and speak with a Program Manager/Advisor to determine how to make up for a failed course.
+
 (b) Students who receive a failed or minimal pass grade will receive a letter from the Robert H. Lee Graduate School cautioning that they are at academic risk and outlining requirements for continuation in the program. A meeting with a Robert H. Lee Graduate School Program Manager/Advisor will also be required to discuss program requirements and to determine any needed actions.
+
 1.5 Academic Standing - Required to Withdraw & Academic Performance Evaluations
+
 (a) A student will be required to withdraw from the program under the following circumstances:
+
 failed in more than 3 credits of courses, or
+
 failed in 3 credits of courses and earned more than 3 credits of minimal pass, or
+
 failed in 1.5 credits of courses and earned more than 4.5 credits of minimal pass, or
+
 more than 6 credits with grades of minimal pass.
+

+
 (b) Students must inform a Program Manager/Advisor at the Robert H. Lee Graduate School of the course name and number to be reviewed.
+
 2.4
+
 If permitted to review, students may be obliged to fully participate in all group work. The instructor determines required participation levels. Students wishing to review a course should carefully consider the additional time commitment required and the effect it might have on academic performance in other courses. This additional time commitment would not be considered as an extenuating circumstance in an appeal of academic standing.

 After completion of foundation courses of their respective Full-time MBA, International MBA, and Professional MBA programs, students may complete up to 35% of their program credits through:
+
 an official Robert H. Lee Graduate school exchange or study abroad program
+
 approved UBC courses outside of the designated program
+
 an approved program of study at another comparable institution
+
 Students should consult with a Program Manager/Advisor to determine when they become eligible for these alternatives.
+
 3.3
+
 A maximum of 6 credits may be taken at the undergraduate 300/400 level; the remaining credits must be taken at the graduate level 500+ (UBC equivalent). All courses must be part of a recognized degree program; executive education, professional development or continuing education courses are not eligible.
+
 3.4

 Any courses outside of the student’s graduate program must be approved by the Robert H. Lee Graduate School prior to registering. Students can contact a Program Manager/Advisor to discuss any options. To gain permission, students must provide a course outline for the desired course as well as information about career goals and how the course would enhance the academic program.
+
 3.5
+
 Students are responsible for any additional course or registration fees associated with courses outside the professional master’s program.
+
 4. Examinations

+
 Exams are administered by the Robert H. Lee Graduate School. The Graduate School will issue the exam schedule.
+
 4.2
+
 For the purposes of this policy, all other final assignments and deliverables due during the exam period, such as presentations and projects, are considered examinations.

 4.3
+
 All exams must be undertaken at the time stated in the exam schedule. Exams will not be re-arranged to accommodate students’ extracurricular activities or personal circumstances such as:
+
 Vacation

 Refer to UBC’s policy on
+
 Academic Concession

+
 4.5
+
 Students must notify the Robert H. Lee Graduate School prior to the start of the exam if they are too ill to write, or if unanticipated events or circumstances arise that interfere with their ability to write the exam.
+
 UBC’s policy on Academic Concession
+
 permits a self-declaration for first occurrences of an acute illness that is likely to be quickly resolved without seeing a health professional (replacing a medical note), or for when a student first seeks an academic concession on compassionate grounds. To make a self-declaration, students should complete the Academic Concession Request & Declaration Form available
+
 here
+
 . Exams will be deferred until the student has returned to good health. A new exam date will be set by the Graduate School.
+
 4.6

 Students with
+
 examination hardship or clashes, as defined by UBC policy
+
 , must contact the Program Manager/Advisor by the communicated deadline to organize alternate exam sittings.
+

+
 4.8
+
 UBC Academic Regulations on student conduct during examinations
+
 state that no candidate shall be permitted to enter the exam room after the expiration of one-half hour from the scheduled starting time, or to leave during the first half hour of the exam. No additional time will be given to students who arrive late, but within the first half hour of the exam.
+
 4.9
+
 Grades are normally submitted to the Faculty/Student Service Centre within seven working days following the date of the final exam, and grades for exams held in the last two days of the exam period are due within five working days.
+
 4.10

 Instructors must keep all completed exams on file for a period of one year.
+
 4.11
+
 Additional Policies for Full-time Programs (Full-time Master of Business Administration, Master of Business Analytics and Master of Management):
+
 (a) Exams, papers, and assignments must be completed by the end of the exam period for the enrolled program. The Robert H. Lee Graduate School will set the exam schedule in consultation with instructors and students to avoid examination hardship. The Robert H. Lee Graduate School will endeavour to schedule all exams between Monday and Friday, but due to conflicts and classroom availability, some exams may be scheduled on Saturday. Students must keep the Saturday of the exam period free.
+
 (b) Any student with Examination Hardship defined as THREE or more exams within a 24-hour period should report this to the Robert H. Lee Graduate School by the communicated deadline. Failure to notify the School of 3 exams within 24 hours by the deadline given may result in students not being able to have an alternate exam sitting.
+
 4.12
+
 Additional Policies for Part-time Programs (Professional Master of Business Administration and International Master of Business Administration):
+
 (a) All examinations, papers, and assignments must be completed by the date scheduled on the respective program calendar. For PMBA, this is usually a Saturday or Sunday. For the IMBA, this is usually a Friday. The exam date is set by the Robert H. Lee Graduate School and published to students in advance of the beginning of each course.
+
 (b) Essential business travel is the only legitimate reason to be permitted an alternate exam sitting. Requests for alternate sittings are to be sent directly to the Program Manager/Advisor; instructors do not approve alternate sittings. A note from the student’s employer detailing the essential business travel (dates/times/location), and proof of travel is required. When approved, alternate sittings will be offered before the official exam date/time.
+
 5. Overloading
+
 5.1
+
 The term “overloading” refers to taking additional courses beyond the standard credit value of the courses associated with a program.
+
 5.2
+
 An overload will be permitted under the following conditions:
+
 (a) The student attained an overall academic average of at least 80% to-date, including all attempted courses.
+
 (b) There are seats available in the requested overload course.
+
 Additional restrictions for each program are listed below.
+
 5.3
+
 Overloading is not acceptable as an extenuating circumstance in an appeal on academic standing.
+
 5.4 Full-Time Master of Business Administration Students:
+
 (a) Overloading is only permitted in Periods 4, 6, and 7 to a maximum of 1.5 credits per period. (See dates for academic periods
+
 here
+
 .
+
 (b) Overloading of courses prior to going on exchange does not exempt students from taking a full course load at their exchange partner school. Our exchange agreements are predicated upon students participating and contributing fully at their exchange partner school, and this includes taking a full course load.
+
 (c) For timelines and application to overload, refer to the Full-time Master of Business Administration program site.
+
 5.5 Professional Master of Business Administration & International Master of Business Administration:
+
 (a) Overloading is only permitted after completion of four advanced courses. Students who complete more than the required amount of credits for their program are required to meet the Academic Standing requirements as identified in section 1.5.
+
 (b) A maximum overload of 1.5 credits per period, or 4.5 credits (3 courses) per term may be permitted.
+
 (c) For timelines and application to overload, refer to the PMBA or IMBA program site.
+

+
 Overloading is generally not permitted. In exceptional circumstances, overloading may be permitted with the approval of the Program Manager and Director at the RHL Graduate School.
+
 5.7 Master of Business Analytics:
+
 Overloading is generally not permitted. In exceptional circumstances, overloading may be permitted with the approval of the Program Manager and Director at the Robert H. Lee Graduate school.
+
 6. Professionalism, Attendance & Behaviour
+
 6.1 General Expectations & Scope
+
 (a) The Robert H. Lee Graduate School admits candidates who demonstrate the potential to become both business leaders and ambassadors of UBC and the Sauder School of Business. In accepting our offer of admission to a graduate program at the Sauder School, students commit to upholding the highest standard of professional behaviour and integrity. This Section describes the required behaviour towards and during classes and activities organized or supported by the Robert H. Lee Graduate School, and the conduct expected during interactions with faculty, staff, and fellow students, regardless of the medium or occasion.
+
 (b) These standards of professionalism apply also to students outside of the Robert H. Lee Graduate School who enrol in BAXX courses. This policy is provided to all such students at the start of each course.
+
 (c) As members of the UBC community, students are expected to familiarize themselves with UBC’s standards for
+
 Academic Integrity
+
 and uphold those standards throughout their program.
+
 6.2 Attendance
+
 (a) Students are expected to attend 100% of their scheduled class hours. Students may make requests for academic concession in the event that students experience unanticipated events or circumstances that interfere with their ability to accomplish academic work. Students should make requests for academic concession by submitting the Academic Concession Request & Declaration Form available
+
 here
+
 .
+
 UBC’s policy on Academic Concession
+
 permits a self-declaration for first occurrences of an acute illness likely to be quickly resolved without seeing a health professional (replacing a medical note), or for when a student first seeks an academic concession on compassionate grounds. Absent students limit their own academic potential, and that of their classmates, and cause unnecessary disruption to the learning environment.
+
 (b) Students missing more than 20% of the total scheduled class hours for a course (including classes held during the add/drop period) without having received an academic concession will be withdrawn from that course. Such a withdrawal results in a “W” if it occurs within the withdrawal with “W” period. If this course withdrawal is after the withdrawal with “W” period, the student will receive up to 50% and an “F” standing for the course on the transcript.
+
 (c) In cases of absence without academic concession being granted by the Robert H. Lee Graduate School, due dates for assignments remain unchanged and instructors may deduct participation points for missed classes.
+
 (d) Examinations for courses in full-time programs will not normally be rescheduled for professional, personal, or co-curricular conflicts.
+
 (e) Provided certain conditions are met, examinations for courses in part-time programs may be rescheduled due to essential business travel required by the student’s employer. Students should refer to the policy on Examinations for further details.
+
 (f) It should be noted that ‘signing in’ for another student at a scheduled class is considered academic misconduct, and such cases will be investigated in accordance with UBC’s procedures for Academic Misconduct.
+
 6.3 Impact of Non-Attendance on Program Completion
+
 (a) Students who are withdrawn from a course due to non-attendance will be advised on the alternatives available to complete the necessary credits. Depending on the program, the nature of the course(s), and the time of year, these alternatives may be limited and graduation may be delayed.
+
 (b) Students will not normally be able to replace credits with courses from outside of the degree for which they are registered. Exceptions may be made for up to 6 credits at the discretion of the Program Manager and Program Director at the Robert H. Lee Graduate School.
+
 6.4 Tardiness
+
 (a) As with any professional environment, students are expected to arrive for classes and activities on time and fully prepared to engage. Students who are late for a class or activity may be refused entry at the discretion of the instructor or activity lead. In such cases, the student will be treated as absent for that class and fall under the provisions for attendance stated above.
+
 (b) Students arriving later than halfway through a scheduled class will be treated as absent for that class and fall under the provisions for attendance stated above, even if the instructor allows them to continue in the classroom.
+
 6.5 Use of Electronic Devices in Class
+
 (a) Research shows that students’ use of laptops in class has negative implications for the learning environment, including reducing their own grades and the grades of those sitting around them. As a result, the Robert H. Lee Graduate School has a ‘lids down’ default in all its classes. This means that students should only open their laptops when asked to by the instructor in order to undertake a specific activity.
+
 (b) Similarly, cell phones, digital tablets, and other personal technology must be turned off during class and stowed away.
+
 (c) Students who do not follow the School’s policy in this regard may be required to leave the room for the remainder of the class, so that they do not distract others. In such cases, students will be treated as absent for that class and fall under the provisions for attendance stated above.
+
 6.6 Behaviour towards faculty, staff, fellow students, and guests
+
 (a)As with any professional environment, students are expected to demonstrate respect for their colleagues at all times, including faculty, staff, fellow students, and guests. The Robert H. Lee Graduate School expects all its students, as future business leaders, to meet their obligations, conduct themselves professionally, and communicate courteously.
+
 (b) Students should also be aware of the University’s
+
 Code of Conduct
+
 and the related discipline measures. Any conduct on the part of a student that has an adverse effect on the integrity of the School or the University, or cause harm to its members or the general public, will be subject to the principles set out in the Code of Conduct.
+
 7. Transferring between Professional Master’s Degrees in Business
+
 7.1
+
 Should a student wish to change degree programs within the Robert H. Lee Graduate School, the following process must be followed:
+
 (a) The student must complete the full application package and meet all program admissions requirements for the desired program.
+
 (b) If admitted, a maximum of 12 credits or up to 40% of the total number of degree credits of previously completed coursework may be applied toward the new degree requirements, provided the courses were completed no earlier than five years from the date of readmission and the courses are applicable to the new degree.
+
 (c) Courses eligible for transfer must have been awarded a grade of at least B (74%).
+
 (d) The student must voluntarily withdraw from the current program before beginning the new program.
+
 (e) Normal program requirements apply to the new program, as does the standard time allowed for degree completion.
+
 8. Withdrawals, Reinstatement & Readmission
+
 8.1 Voluntary Withdrawal
+
 (a) A student wishing to withdraw from the University must notify the Robert H. Lee Graduate School in writing. The withdrawal becomes effective once officially approved in writing by the School. The academic record will indicate “Voluntary Withdrawal.” The academic record will show the date of withdrawal and a standing of “W” in all courses not completed on the approval date. Any refund of tuition and fees will follow the University’s refund policy. Fees will continue to be assessed until the School grants written approval for the voluntary withdraw.
+
 (b) A student who voluntarily withdraws may return to the program through readmission, as outlined in the
+
 Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies policies
+
 . The Robert H. Lee Graduate School does not permit reinstatements.
+
 8.2 Mandatory Withdrawal (Required to Withdraw)
+
 (a) A student who is required to withdraw from the program may appeal to the Dean of the Faculty, and if unsuccessful, may finally appeal to the Senate’s Committee on Appeals on Academic Standing.
+
 (b) A student who is required to withdraw from the program will not be permitted to attend classes during an appeal process.
+
 (c) A student who is required to withdraw from the program will not be reinstated or readmitted to the program.

 Bachelor of Business in Real Estate
+
 The Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration, through its Real Estate Division (RED), offers a post-diploma degree completion program that leads to the Bachelor of Business in Real Estate (B.B.R.E.). The program requires the completion of the
+
 Diploma in Urban Land Economics
+
 or equivalent plus additional real estate, general education, and business courses. The real estate courses are delivered by the RED, which is located in the Michael A. Goldberg Centre for Real Estate and Distance Education, while an agreement with Thompson Rivers University will enable students to obtain the required general education and business courses.
+
 The Bachelor of Business in Real Estate is a part-time program, delivered by distance education methods. The program allows industry professionals to continue their careers while simultaneously advancing their formal education beyond the diploma level in order that they may prepare to meet the challenges and opportunities of an increasingly complex and dynamic industry. The curriculum has been developed in consultation with the real estate industry to ensure it meets the accreditation requirements of the various professional associations.

 COMM 271 - Introduction to Capital Markets (formerly COMM 286V)
+
 COMM 271 - Introduction to Capital Markets (formerly COMM 286V)
+
 COMM 271 provides an academically rigorous overview of the capital markets and the functions of the players in those markets. The course will combine examining the markets from a purely economic perspective as well as seeing the markets from the professional’s perspective; the professional perspective will be provided by capital markets professionals. Students will be responsible for integrating the academic and professional perspectives of the markets.
+
 Much of the material will be self-taught, as student teams (organized by the instructors) take turns presenting class lectures, supplemented by the instructors.
+
 Learning objectives
+
 The objective of the course is to allow students who MAY have an interest in finance and the global capital markets to:
+
 identify institutions and careers in capital markets that align with their skills and interest
+
 apply fundamental valuation techniques to stock and bond investments
+
 understand written and verbal communications that are commonplace in capital markets
+
 describe firm characteristics that are associated with fundamental firm value
+
 convey written and verbal arguments on the fairness of valuation of stocks
+
 Admission
+
 Admission to COMM 271 is by application only, and is restricted to BCom students entering Year 2. To apply, please submit ONE pdf file containing: (i) a cover letter, (ii) a 1-page resume, and (iii) a list of university grades (a printout of your grades summary from the Student Service Centre is sufficient) to Robert Heinkel
+
 robert.heinkel@sauder.ubc.ca
+
 .
+
 For the 2023 Winter Session, the deadline to apply is
+
 Friday,
+
 May 5, 2023 at 4:00pm
+
 for direct-entry students
+
 and
+
 Friday, July 7, 2023 at 4:00pm
+
 for transfer students
+
 (eligible students will receive an email invitation to apply). Successful applicants will be notified of acceptance in either early to mid June (direct-entry) or late July (transfers), and then registered in the course in July.
+
 Students with a pre-existing interest in the capital markets may also consider applying to the
+
 UBC Portfolio Management Foundation Program (PMF)
+
 in their second year, however, note that admission to COMM 271 in June is not a factor in the selection of students for the PMF. This course is designed to help students prepare themselves for a capital markets career regardless of whether they plan to participate in the PMF program.
+
 Note: This course was formerly numbered first as COMM 486V, and then as COMM 286V. If you took the course as COMM 486V, it is still counted as a lower-level elective.

 Graduation
+
 If you've completed all of your degree requirements, it's time to graduate. Congratulations!
+
 Preparing for graduation
+
 You’ve worked hard to get here so let’s make it an awesome occasion for you, your proud family and friends.
+
 Graduation ceremonies are held annually in May and November. You must complete your degree requirements by the end of August to be eligible to graduate in the November ceremony or by the end of April to graduate in the May ceremony.
+
 In order to graduate, you must complete the graduation application on the
+
 Student Service Centre (SSC)
+
 . Apply by February 24 for the May ceremony or by September 15 for the November ceremony.
+
 Your application to graduate will be reviewed in April for the May ceremony or in October for the November ceremony. The final approval will be noted on your graduation application on the SSC approximately one week prior to the ceremony. Note that if you achieve a winter session average below 60% in your final year, you will be permitted to graduate, however, a notation of ‘Failed Year’ will appear on your academic transcript for that session.
+
 You must complete your BCom degree requirements within six years of your original admission to the UBC Sauder School of Business. It’s up to you to make sure that you've fulfilled all program requirements when applying to graduate. Check your
+
 program requirements
+
 and contact the
+
 Undergraduate Office
+
 if you have any questions.
+
 Degree credit check
+
 If after checking you still have questions or you’re unsure about whether or not you have fulfilled all of your degree requirements, you can submit a request for a degree credit check to be done by our office. The form to request a degree check is at
+
 webforms.sauder.ubc.ca/degree-credit-check
+
 (allow at least ten business days for processing).
+
 Request degree credit check
+

+
 Learn more about your graduation day including ceremony instructions, schedules, tickets, gown rentals, and photos.
+
 Graduation at UBC
+
 Declaring a second option, minor, or concentration
+
 Once the graduation application deadline has passed, the Undergraduate Office will send instructions to all applicants for how to affirm their expected completion of a second option, minor, or concentration, if applicable. Please ensure you submit your most up-to-date minor forms before obtaining your degree. 
 
 At the time of graduation, completion of a second option, minor, or concentration will be noted on your transcript.
+
 Degree with Honours
+
 The words 'with Honours' will be placed on your transcript and your degree certificate if you meet the following conditions:
+
 achieve an average of 80% or greater on all senior-level (300 and 400-level) Commerce courses (COMM and COHR).
+
 1
+
 Senior-level (300 and 400-level) CPSC courses are also included for students in the Combined Major in Business & Computer Science (BUCS). The average is calculated to 2 decimal points and is not rounded.
+
 EXCEPTION
+
 :
+
 If you
+
 HAVE
+
 Cr/D/F grades for any senior-level COMM/COHR (and CPSC for BUCS) in 2019W Term 2, then
+
 ALL
+
 senior-level COMM/COHR (and CPSC for BUCS) courses taken in 2019W Term 2 are
+
 EXCLUDED
+
 from your graduating average calculation.
+
 2
+
 If you
+
 DO NOT HAVE
+
 Cr/D/F grades for any senior-level COMM/COHR (and CPSC for BUCS) in 2019W Term 2, then
+
 ALL
+
 senior-level COMM/COHR (and CPSC for BUCS) courses taken in 2019W Term 2 are
+
 INCLUDED
+
 in your graduating average calculation.
+
 meet
+
 ONE OF
+
 the following credit requirements
+
 3,4
+
 :
+
 24 percentage-graded credits in Year 3 or Year 4,
+
 OR
+
 At least 24 credits in Year 3 or Year 4 in the 2019 Winter Session including 12 percentage-graded credits in 2019W Term 1
+
 1
+
 If you were registered in Year 2 or above during the 2014 Winter Session, COMM 203 (COMM 392 equivalent), COMM 204 (COMM 399 equivalent), and COMM 205 (COMM 391 equivalent) will be included in the calculation of your average. If you were in Year 1 during the 2014 Winter Session and took any of COMM 391, COMM 392, COMM 399 during the 2015 Summer Session or prior, your grades for those courses will not be used to determine eligibility to achieve a Degree with Honours.
+
 2
+
 If you have CR/D/F grades for any senior-level COMM/COHR (and CPSC for BUCS) in 2019W Term 2 and you have taken a six-credit percentage-graded COMM course during 2019W that spanned Terms 1 and 2 (COMM 466, COMM 486W), your percentage grade for the six-credit course will be included in your graduating average calculation, however, it will be weighted for only 3 credits rather than 6 credits.

 Students who graduated in May 2019 or prior were required to be registered in at least 27 percentage-graded credits during the winter session in at least one of Year 3 or Year 4 of the program. For those students in the Co-op program and registered at UBC for only one term in the winter session because of a Co-op placement, they had to have been in 15 percentage-graded credits in their non-Co-op term to be eligible.

 If you're a Co-op student and you're registered at UBC for only one term in the winter session because of a Co-op placement, you must be in 12 percentage-graded credits in your non-Co-op term to be eligible. If you participate in an exchange program, your grades earned while on exchange will be included in the calculation.
+
 If you're unable to calculate your eligibility to achieve a Degree with Honours yourself, you can confirm your Honours status at the Undergraduate Office after May 19 for the spring ceremony and November 20 for the fall ceremony.

 Yogmaya Singh & Bhavika Mahtani
+
 Clara Chu
+
 Sang Le
+
 Sang Le received funds to attend Groceryshop 2022 Conference in Las Vegas Nevada
+
 UGO Student Experience Grant recipient, Sang Le
+
 How did the experience impact you?
+
 As the co-founder of Peko, an “imperfect” grocery delivery startup, I often make key decisions that can drive the direction of my company. However, there is so much to learn as I wear a lot of hats - handling anything from marketing, and operations, to fundraising. As a result, being able to meet industry experts all over North America, coming from firms such as Instacart, Pinterest, Imperfect Foods, PepsiCo, and more has been extremely helpful. Not only did it teach me about emerging trends in the grocery industry, but I also better understand the struggles and growing pains.
+
 Moreover, the conference also allowed me to build my network with top executives (often VP and above), and foster strategic partnerships. For example, I got to connect with the CEO of a reusable packaging company to help further our mission to reduce waste.
+
 I am extremely thankful for this opportunity and thank the UGO for offering me this grant.
+
 Bineet Agarwal
+
 UGO Student Experience Grant recipient, Bineet Agarwal
+
 Bineet Agarwal used Student Experience Grant funding to attend ICSC New York Conference in New York.
+
 How did the experience impact you?
+
 ICSC New York has always been at the top of my list of networking events to attend. I've always heard great things about the ICSC networking events and have always wanted to attend.
+
 Attending the event gave me insight into how the industry looks and operates from the inside. Being able to witness live deals and acquisitions taught me a lot and I took this opportunity to continue to build my network of real estate industry professionals. Not only did I learn about industry trends which I plan to share on my return to Vancouver, but it also gave me the confidence and experience I needed to talk to prospective employers.
+
 Sam Chen
+
 UGO Student Experience Grant recipient, Sam Chen
+
 Sam Chen secured Student Experience Grand funding to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Conference 2022 in Bangkok Thailand
+
 How did the experience impact you?
+
 Attending the 2022 Asia Pacific Economic Conference (APEC) in Bangkok, Thailand was a profound experience that exposed me to diverse perspectives and inspired me to think differently.
+
 As a part of the Voices of the Future (VOF) program, I interacted with other delegates from member economies and learned more about their respective domestic affairs, institutions, and culture. Most notably, I collaborated with delegates from Australia, Mexico, and Thailand to propose policy initiatives for accessible health care reform and pitched it to a panel of experts.
+
 The highlight of the experience was meeting Prime Minister Trudeau to briefly share what we learned and ask him a few questions on domestic policy initiatives (and take a few photos)!
+
 Yogmaya Singh & Bhavika Mahtani
+
 UGO Student Experience Grant recipients, Yogmaya Singh (left) and Bhavika Mahtani (right)
+
 Yogmaya Singh & Bhavika Mahtani used Student Experience Grant funding to launch a new initiative called the Creative Industries Network.
+
 How did this experience impact you?
+
 The Student Experience Grant provided us with a unique experience at Sauder. It opened a lot of doors for us that were initially inaccessible, and allowed us to explore our passions alongside our careers. We discovered the Grant when we were searching for resources to help jump start our initiative of the Creative Industries Network. We both were passionate about a career in the creative industries and due to the lack of existing opportunities, we felt responsible for bridging that gap. After approaching the Undergraduate Office with our idea, we were received with open arms and were provided with overwhelming support. With the funding and guidance from the Grant, we were able to host our very own launch event that not only cultivated our community but built our confidence in leading such an initiative. Since then, we’ve transformed the Creative Industries Network from an event to a CUS affiliated club!
+
 Clara Chu
+
 UGO Student Experience Grant recipient, Clara Chu
+
 Clara received funds to attend the Grace Hopper Conference for women in tech.
+
 How did the experience impact you?
+
 It was eye-opening to see new technology disrupting the world. I had the opportunity to attend the recruitment fair and it's crazy to realize how in demand tech-related positions are – especially when considering the level of diversity in the workforce. In addition, I had the opportunity to meet influential leaders such as Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Square and Twitter.

 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)
+
 Are entrepreneurial pursuits eligible for funding?
+
 This fund is not intended to finance start up businesses. For this type of funding, please look into opportunities at
+
 entrepreneurship@UBC
+
 .
+
 Am I able to fund my Go Global/Exchange experience?
+
 This grant is not to be used to fund any experiences for which BCom students will receive credits that count towards their degrees, thus Go Global is ineligible for funding. Go Global does typically offer financial subsidies however. For more information, see here:
+
 https://global.ubc.ca/go-global
+
 .
+
 I’m attending a Case Competition/Conference that is outside of the lower mainland. How many nights am I able to request funding for?
+
 Funding is available for accommodation for a total nights:
+
 # of conference days + 1
+
 I’m attending a Case Competition/Conference. What elements of my experience are eligible to be included in my budget request?
+
 Reimbursement is available for: major travel (airplane/trains), cost of hotel/AirBnB, and event registration fees. Funding is not eligible for minor travel (taxi/Uber/transit) nor food/grocery costs.
+
 I’m applying for the grant for a team activity, but my teammate paid for everything.
+
 Your team is still able to be reimbursed, however the reimbursed amount would go to the person whose name is on the receipts. The person whose name is on the receipts must be a BCom student. Your team would then coordinate payments between team members on your own terms. This is not the responsibility of UBC Sauder.
+
 I am applying for the grant for a team activity. Does this mean that my entire team is ineligible to apply for further grant funding for the next three academic years?
+
 If the grant is to fund a student led event or initiative, the initiative will not be eligible for another grant but all organizing members are still eligible to apply for personal grants in the future.
+
 If the committee decides to fund my application, however I do not accept, would I still have to wait three academic years before applying again?
+
 No – The three-year rule would only apply to applicants who received/were reimbursed for any amount of funding from the grant.
+
 As an applicant for a Student Led Initiative, what should I be cognizant of in my application?
+
 The Student Experience Grant is looking to fund opportunities where applicants: (1) are proposing a new, innovative, and clearly defined program to fill a niche not already being filled for current BCom students. (2) have a clear funding breakdown of how the funds will be spent. (3) are able to provide justification and rationale for how they plan to implement the initiative, at scale.
+
 How will I receive funding from the UGO Grant?
+
 For individuals attending Volunteer/Service Learning/Case Competition/Conferences, once all of the purchases have been made, please submit all receipts through the funding acceptance form by the term deadline. Only then will UBC Sauder Finance reimburse these costs.
+
 For organizers of Student Led Initiatives, if you are applying on behalf of an organization, your organization will invoice the UGO Grant and UBC Sauder Finance will pay the invoice. If you are an individual organizing an initiative, we will reimburse receipts after they have been purchased or you may direct your partners to invoice UBC Sauder directly. The UGO Grant does not pay invoices from individual students.

 Funding your studies
+
 Student loans, scholarships, bursaries, and employment are all ways for you to finance your studies. Take time to understand the full range of financial support options available to you so that you can spend less time worrying about money and more time focusing on your coursework.
+
 Financial support for students
+
 Maintain your eligibility for student loans
+
 Government loans, grants, and interest-free status all require students to be enrolled in at least 60% (80% for Newfoundland loans) of a full-time course load in each term. Given the credit structure of the BCom program, the minimum number of credits you must be enrolled in varies at different year levels. Consult the course load guide at students.ubc.ca to ensure that you meet the requirements to maintain your funding. Note that eligibility to receive scholarships and to live in UBC residence is determined by separate registration criteria.
+
 Consult the course load guide
+

 Completion of the Business Law concentration does not require pre-approval or special admission. If you would like to pursue this concentration, complete a total of 12 credits of business law-related courses as listed below.
+
 The 12 credits also count toward fulfillment of your electives requirement, but note that COMM and COHR courses cannot be counted as non-Commerce electives.

 Approval to take Law courses is at the discretion of the Peter A. Allard School of Law and subject to your academic readiness and available space in courses. See below for instructions on how to request registration.
+
 Taking LAW courses offered by the Peter A. Allard School of Law
+
 Courses offered by the Allard School of Law are academically rigorous. They will require you to devote significant time and effort to do well. Be aware that your performance in these courses can impact a future application to law school and your ability to secure related employment opportunities.
+
 Completion of a Law course cannot be applied toward any future Allard Law degree (i.e., credits cannot be double counted).
+
 Law course schedule
+
 Law courses at UBC are administered by the Peter A. Allard School of Law. Courses and timetables offered for 2023-24 are posted on the
+
 Allard Law website
+
 .
+
 Law course availability and request process
+
 Juris Doctor (law) students will register for most of their courses during the first two weeks of July. LAW 459, LAW 316, and LAW 334 are popular among law students. Only after law students have registered will students in other programs be considered for any remaining seats, if any.
+
 To request registration you must complete and return to Allard Law a
+
 Permission for a Non-Law Student to Register in a Law Course
+
 according to the instructions in the form and by the deadlines for each term as specified:
+
 August 4, 2023 for Fall Term courses
+
 November 24, 2023 for Spring Term courses
+
 The form must also be signed by an academic advisor in the UBC Sauder Undergraduate Office before you submit it to Allard Law. Although the form states that non-law students cannot apply to take LAW 459 Business Organizations, this rule does not apply to BCom students who are completing the Business Law concentration. Advisors will only approve forms for students in Year 3 or above.
+
 With the form you are required to attach a separate page on which you briefly indicate (i) your reasons for taking the course and (ii) why you feel academically prepared to take the course. By completing and submitting this form, you are allowing UBC Law to access your UBC academic record.
+
 The Law Associate Dean, Academic Affairs, will review all requests after the submission deadline. If your request is approved, Allard Academic Services staff will register you in the LAW course(s) and notify you by email on the first day of the term in which the class will be held.
+
 Law course examinations and grading rules
+
 BCom students are subject to the same
+
 Allard Law Examination and Grading rules
+
 as law students.
+
 Allard Law Academic Services internally schedules and manages all Allard Law examinations. Because law exams are not scheduled by Enrolment Services, they will not be published on the Student Service Centre with your other final exams. The Law December and April exam schedules will be posted on the
+
 Allard website
+
 well before Enrolment Services schedules exams for other courses.
+
 If you have an exam conflict with a Law course and a non-Law course, you are expected to write the Law exam as scheduled
+
 . You must make arrangements to write the non-Law course exam at another time. If you have a conflict, please report it to the
+
 Undergraduate Office
+
 immediately so that we can assist you with alternate exam arrangements.
+
 Will the Business Law concentration appear on my transcript?
+
 Yes! Successful completion of the Business Law concentration will be noted on your transcript after graduation.

 International Business Concentration
+
 International Business Concentration
+
 Obtain a deeper understanding of multinational businesses and how such businesses need to work with the regulations and people of different nations and cultures.
+
 With the addition of the new International Business (IB) concentration in September 2021, the
+
 International Business option
+
 will be discontinued. Students who started Year 1 in 2020W will be the last cohort eligible to complete the option. Current IB option students can choose to complete the IB concentration instead, but they cannot complete both.
+
 Course requirements
+
 Completion of the International Business concentration does not require pre-approval or special admission. If you would like to pursue this concentration, complete a total of 12 credits of internationally-oriented courses including COMM 498, and participate in an approved international exchange/study abroad program.
+
 The 12 credits also count toward fulfillment of your electives requirement, but note that COMM courses cannot be counted as non-Commerce electives. If the courses you take for the concentration overlap with the courses you take for an option or minor, or if you plan to use COMM 498 to fulfill your capstone requirement, you can double count a maximum of 3 credits of coursework in your degree toward both the concentration and one of either an option, a minor, or your capstone requirement.
+
 After you've applied to graduate, we'll provide instructions for how to declare the concentration so that it will appear on your academic transcript.
+

 Changes to the Minor in Commerce course codes
+
 Starting in 2020S, the course code for all courses required for the Minor in Commerce will be COMR. This change was made to distinguish Commerce courses taken for the minor from courses taken for the BCom program. This is an administrative change only; course content remains the same. COMM and COMR courses of the same number are equivalent; credit will be granted for only one of the two. Any courses previously completed with the COMM code may still be used to fulfill Minor in Commerce requirements.
+
 Round out your education by completing a Minor in Commerce. Study through Flexible Learning, traditional in-class lectures or a combination of both.
+
 Overview
+
 If you are completing a program other than the Bachelor of Commerce, you may be eligible to complete a Minor in Commerce. Contact your home faculty and consult the
+
 UBC Calendar
+
 for further information regarding eligibility, course requirements, and application procedures.
+
 Many of the Minor courses are offered in a Flexible Learning format to allow you take them with your own program requirements. You may also take courses from the program prior to your acceptance to the Minor if space permits.
+
 If you are completing the
+
 UBC Bachelor + Master of Management Dual Degree
+
 , you are not eligible to complete a Minor in Commerce.
+
 Why a Minor in Commerce?
+
 Understanding the fundamentals of business can give you an edge in the job market, as well as complement your other areas of study. As a Minor in Commerce student, you will gain a solid grounding in core areas of business - accounting, finance, marketing, organizational behavior and business strategy.
+

+
 Note: course requirements for the Minor in Commerce vary by faculty. Consult your home faculty for additional information.
+
 How do I register for a course if it’s full?
+
 No waitlists will be available for fully subscribed sections. If you wish to register in a course that is full, keep checking enrolment and register yourself if a seat becomes available. All requests regarding course registration should be directed to the UBC Sauder Undergraduate Office through the
+
 registration assistance form
+
 . Course instructors cannot approve the addition of students to their courses.
+
 What is Flexible Learning?
+
 In “Flex” courses, you’ll spend approximately 20-70% of your time studying with online learning materials in preparation for far fewer scheduled classes, rather than attending traditional lectures in person.
+
 When you register for Minor in Commerce courses, you can choose Flexible Learning, in-class learning, or a combination of the two by taking some “Flex” courses and some traditional in-class courses. Flexible sections are labeled with the Activity type 'Flexible Learning' on the course schedule.
+
 What are the benefits of Flexible Learning?
+
 With Flexible Learning, most of your learning happens outside the classroom. That allows for more time in class to help you put ideas into action and develop the critical thinking and analytical skills today’s employers demand. This delivery method gives you far more flexibility for combining a Minor in Commerce with your other studies.
+
 Who is Flexible Learning best suited for?
+
 This format is ideal for independent students who are self-motivated, self-regulated and comfortable with less face-to-face interaction.
+

+
 Interested in taking other Commerce courses outside of the Commerce Minor?
+
 Many Commerce courses are restricted to students enrolled in the BCom program, but there are some which are open to students from other faculties. Visit our course search and select 'Courses open to students not in the BCom program' under the Program field for a full list.

 Business Analytics Concentration
+
 Learn how Big Data is changing the way organizations face business challenges.
+
 Big Data is transforming our daily lives, businesses, and our society at large. With the advance of mobile computing, social media, and the Internet of Things, companies can collect detailed data on various individual, organizational, and societal activities. Business Analytics allows one to analyze such Big Data to extract insights and to make data-driven decisions on business and societal problems. The Business Analytics concentration will expose you to the concepts and techniques in business analytics and decision making, enabling you to thrive in the data-driven business world.
+
 Course requirements
+
 Completion of the Business Analytics concentration does not require pre-approval or special admission. If you would like to pursue this concentration, complete a total of 12 credits of analytics-related courses as listed below.
+
 The 12 credits also count toward fulfillment of your electives requirement, but note that COMM courses cannot be counted as non-Commerce electives. If the courses you take for a concentration overlap with the courses you take for an option or minor, you can double count a maximum of 3 credits of coursework in your degree toward both the concentration and one of either one option or one minor.
+
 After you've applied to graduate, we'll provide instructions for how to declare the concentration so that it will appear on your academic transcript.

 UBCO Cross Campus Mobility
+
 Experience a change of scenery and explore more of what UBC has to offer by spending some time at UBC’s Okanagan campus.
+
 Thanks to the 2009 partnership between the UBC Sauder School of Business and the Faculty of Management, you can now expand the foundation of your degree as well as experience the intimacy of learning at a small campus. UBCO cross campus mobility allows students to spend a term of Year 4 of the BCom program studying at the UBCO Faculty of Management.
+
 Surrounded by orchards and vineyards, UBC’s state-of-the-art Okanagan campus is located in sunny Kelowna, BC. During the summer you can lounge on lakeside sandy beaches, or hike and mountain bike nearby trails. In the winter, the region’s legendary champagne powder makes for fantastic skiing and snowboarding.

 UBC Sauder Public Speaking Competition
+
 UBC Sauder Public Speaking Competition
+
 Each year, UBC Sauder's best undergraduate orators compete for $4,000 in scholarships and the title of Public Speaking Champion.
+
 The UBC Sauder Public Speaking Competition is an annual invitational event for which COMM 395 Business Communications instructors nominate their most capable students from the past 12 months. Selected participants compete in a preliminary knockout round by recording and submitting speeches for the judging committee. Short-listed finalists are then invited to compete in front of an audience, delivering both prepared and impromptu presentations.
+
 The 2023 competition
+
 In the 2023 competition, each finalist was asked to prepare a six minute presentation on the one of two topics, '
+
 Is it wrong to tell students to pursue academic disciplines that they enjoy instead of those that have more promising career options?'
+
 or '
+
 What is the best time period and genre of music?'
+
 They were then tasked with giving a two to three minute impromptu address in response to the question, '
+
 My favourite clothes: what are they and why have I chosen them?'
+
 The 2023 finalists included BComs
+
 Matthew Valinho, Jasleen Mehat, Makayla Zuberbier, Oceanna Nguyen
+
 , and
+
 Keisha Rutega.
+

+
 Campus Closures
+
 At times, the University may decide to cancel or reschedule academic activities and curtail non-essential services in response to extreme weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances. Alerts and updates on campus closures will be available at ubc.ca.
+
 The information below applies to BCom students and all students registered in COMM, COHR, COMR, and COEC courses.
+
 How will I know if my classes or exams are cancelled?
+
 Always check
+
 ubc.ca
+
 for the most up-to-date information about campus closures.
+
 If classes are cancelled, monitor your Canvas Announcements and email for any further direction from your instructors.
+
 If exams are cancelled:
+
 A notice will be posted at
+
 students.ubc.ca/enrolment/exams
+
 .
+
 UBC Enrolment Services will inform affected students via email and provide directions on the next steps.
+
 Instructors may also provide additional information via Canvas Announcements and/or email.
+
 Click here
+
 to learn how to personalize your notifications in Canvas.
+
 A campus closure was announced at ubc.ca on the day and time of my final exam and my final exam was cancelled. When will I write it?
+
 Some instructors may choose to hold a remote exam at the originally scheduled time so that you do not need to be on campus to write the exam in person. It is your responsibility to review the policies listed in your course syllabus and monitor your email and Canvas Announcements for any information provided by your instructor.
+
 If a remote exam is offered at the original scheduled date and time
+
 If your instructor has notified you that your exam will be administered remotely online, please follow their instructions, and write the exam as scheduled. You will not be required to be on campus to write it.
+
 If you are prevented from writing your remote, online exam:
+
 If you face any extenuating circumstance that prevents you from writing the exam remotely, you must request an
+
 academic concession
+
 as soon as possible and within 48 hours of the originally scheduled time.
+
 If you have valid grounds for concession, your request will be approved, and you will be expected to write your exam in person at the rescheduled time (see below). Only students approved for an academic concession can write the rescheduled exam.
+
 Apply for academic concession
+
 Students registered with the
+
 Centre for Accessibility (CFA)
+
 who require exam accommodations that cannot be facilitated through a remote exam should plan to write the exam at the rescheduled sitting, with the assurance that the CFA will offer the appropriate support.
+
 Please note that once you have started an exam, the grade you earn will stand. You will not be given another opportunity to increase your mark.
+
 If an exam has been rescheduled
+
 If your in-person exam has been cancelled and a remote exam sitting is not available, you should continue to prepare for the exam. You will be expected to write the exam in person when campus reopens.
+
 Cancelled exams are rescheduled by Enrolment Services as follows:
+
 Winter Term 1 examinations will be rescheduled for the Saturday (and when necessary, the Sunday) following the first full week of classes in Winter Term 2.
+
 Winter Term 2 and Summer examinations will be rescheduled on the day(s) following the last day of the formal final exam period for that term.
+
 The location, time, and date for your rescheduled exam will be posted at
+
 students.ubc.ca/enrolment/exams/exam-schedule
+
 .
+
 Your rescheduled exam will also be listed in your exam schedule on the SSC (Student Service Centre).
+
 If you are prevented from completing your rescheduled exam in person:
+
 The Undergraduate Office will send you a survey to impacted students via email and determine their eligibility to write any rescheduled COMM, COHR, COMR, and COEC exam(s) remotely. Your instructor may post an announcement on Canvas informing you about this survey.
+
 If you are unable to be on campus to write a rescheduled exam in person, please complete the survey at the link found in the email you receive.
+
 The survey link will not be published so you will not be able to access it elsewhere.
+
 It is important to note that no time-zone accommodation will be made for rescheduled exams written remotely.
+
 The
+
 Centre for Accessibility (CFA)
+
 will provide support to eligible students, with approved exam accommodations, for exams rescheduled by Enrolment Services. You must be a registered client of CFA to receive this support.
+

 Frequently Asked Questions
+
 The campus is open but I am unable to write my exam. What should I do?
+
 Please apply for an
+
 academic concession
+
 if you have valid grounds for concession.
+
 If my exam has been rescheduled, how and when will my eligibility to write a rescheduled remote exam be determined?
+
 Requests to write rescheduled exams remotely will not be automatically approved. Once the exam is rescheduled, you will be asked to complete a survey if you cannot write it in person on campus. Once you have submitted the survey, the UGO will determine your eligibility by considering the validity of the grounds of your request and your own individual circumstances.
+
 Please continue to prepare to write your exam and monitor your email and Canvas announcements regularly for additional information as we review your request. You will be informed of your request status one day before the exam at the latest.
+
 There is an issue with my survey. Who should I contact?
+
 Please contact the
+
 Undergraduate Office
+
 immediately if you filled out your survey incorrectly, have any concerns, or your circumstances have changed.
+
 My request to write a remote exam was approved. I won’t be in the Vancouver area so the exam is scheduled at 2:00 AM my local time. What should I do?
+
 Please note that no time-zone accommodation will be provided for rescheduled exams. If you are prevented from writing the rescheduled exam at the time scheduled by Enrolment Services, please apply for an academic concession. If approved, you will be permitted to write the exam in the
+
 Deferred Standing (SD)
+
 period.
+
 Canvas access expires at the end of the term. How can I have access to course materials if exams are scheduled for the following term?
+
 Access to your Canvas course will be extended automatically until the rescheduled exam date.
+
 My exam is cancelled, and it is a non-Commerce exam. What should I do?
+
 If you are a BCom student taking a non-Commerce course (other than COMM, COHR, COMR, and COEC), please follow the directions provided by the instructor or departmental office of the impacted course. The UGO will continue to be responsible for reviewing concession requests from BCom students for these courses.
+
 Our office does not process academic concession requests from non-BCom students taking a Commerce course (COMM, COHR, COMR, and COEC). If you are not a BCom student and require academic concession, please contact your home faculty advising office.

+
 EXCEPTION
+
 :
+
 If you
+
 HAVE
+
 Cr/D/F grades for any senior-level COMM/COHR (and CPSC for BUCS) in 2019W Term 2, then
+
 ALL
+
 senior-level COMM/COHR (and CPSC for BUCS) courses taken in 2019W Term 2 are

 Commerce Scholars Program

 Learn how to conduct leading research under the mentorship of a distinguished faculty member.
+
 The Commerce Scholars Program (CSP) encourages you to draw upon the UBC Sauder School of Business's reputation as Canada’s leading research business school. Under the mentorship of a distinguished faculty member, you’ll work as a research assistant, learn all about the research process and sharpen your critical thinking skills.
+
 Is this program for me?
+
 Research skills – including the ability to define an interesting and relevant question, and formulate and test hypotheses – are important for graduate study as well as for a wide variety of careers in business. This program, starting in Year 3, is well suited for those who wish to consider an academic career, or work in the field of consulting.

 Grades

 While the ultimate measure of success will be your ability to apply what you've learned to your career, grades are an important measure of your understanding of the concepts covered in your courses.
+
 Academic evaluations for continuation and promotion
+
 Each year during the month of May, the Undergraduate Office (UGO) reviews your academic progress and calculates your winter session average based on all courses taken from September to April to determine if you have successfully completed (1) continuation requirements to remain in the program, and  (2) course requirements for promotion to the next year level. If your winter session  average falls below 60% at any year level, you will be considered to have failed the year and will be required to discontinue your studies at UBC for a period of at least one year. Decimals are not rounded (i.e., a winter session average of 59.9% would be a failed year).

 Please note:
+
 Some average course grades outside the recommended range are expected.
+
 Multiple section courses will generally have some variation across sections.
+
 Some classes are exceptional and may be above (or below) the proposed range.
+
 Elective courses tend to have higher grades than required courses in the same group and
+
 may be toward the upper end of the range.
+
 Calculating a weighted average
+
 When calculating your average, you must take the credit values of your courses into consideration. Your one-credit COMM 202 course will have less weight than your three-credit COMM 293 course. Not sure how to calculate a weighted average? Input your anticipated/final grades into our weighted average calculator to see if you're on track to meet continuation requirements.
+
 Weighted average calculator
+
 What if I fail a course?
+
 If you fail a course in Term 1, you may re-register for the same course in Term 2 or in the summer session if the course is offered. If you fail a course twice, you must submit a letter of appeal to the UGO outlining the steps you will take to successfully complete the course. If you fail a course a third time, you will be asked to leave the BCom program permanently.

+
 Viewing marked work
+
 As per UBC policy, you can expect any applicable course work including exams to be marked in a reasonable time frame. You can also expect to receive feedback on expected and achieved outcomes. If you would like to review any course work or exams retained by UBC, you may request a viewing by contacting your instructor by the deadlines as set in the policy. Viewing marked work is purely to help you understand your performance; instructors are not required to provide an answer key or rationale for your marks. This is not meant to be an opportunity for you to dispute your grade with your instructor (see review of assigned standing).
+
 Viewing marked work policy
+
 Review of assigned standing
+
 If you're not satisfied that your course work or exam was graded fairly, you may submit a request for a Review of Assigned Standing. Your work will be regraded by an alternate instructor. When considering whether or not to submit a request, keep in mind that you are limited to two requests per academic year and that you will only receive a refund of the application fee if your final grade increases. It is also possible for your grade to decline.
+
 Review of assigned standing policy
+
 Credit/D/Fail grading policy
+
 The Credit/D/Fail grading policy allows you to take eligible elective courses and safely explore new and exciting subjects, earning a Credit, D, or Fail standing instead of a percentage grade on your academic transcript. These standings are awarded as follows:
+
 Cr is awarded for a grade of 55% or higher.
+
 D is awarded for a grade of 50-54.9%.
+
 F is awarded for a grade of less than 50%, where 50% is the passing grade.
+
 You can take a maximum of six credits of Credit/D/Fail graded courses per session and up to a maximum of 12 credits of Credit/D/Fail graded courses towards your BCom degree.*
+
 * Courses taken for Credit/D/Fail grading during 2019W Term 2 will not be counted toward your 6-credit session limit or your 12-credit degree limit. If you need assistance changing your grading to Credit/D/Fail before the add/drop deadline, please email
+
 bcomquestions@sauder.ubc.ca
+
 with your student number, course code, and section for assistance.
+
 You can take elective courses for Credit/D/Fail as long as they do not fulfill a requirement for a:
+
 Option (including the International Business option)
+
 Minor
+
 Concentration
+
 Combined Major in Business and Computer Science (BUCS) program
+
 First-year BCom students may not take required first-year courses for Credit/D/Fail.
+
 Important: Opting to take a course for Credit/D/Fail grading will impact your eligibility for UBC scholarships and awards if you have not taken the minimum 24 percentage-graded credits required for award evaluation calculations. Also note that you must be registered in at least 24 percentage-graded credits during the winter session in at least one of Year 3 or Year 4 of the program to be eligible for a Degree with Honours.
+
 More about Credit/D/Fail grading
+
 Rankings
+
 Curious as to how well you performed relative to your classmates last year? Every August, the Undergraduate Office receives academic reports ranking students according to their previous winter session average for each year level of the BCom program. You must complete at least 24 credits within the session, from September to April, to be included in the rankings. To learn your ranking, contact the Undergraduate Office after August 15.
+
 Do summer course grades matter?
+
 While grades from summer courses are not included in the calculation of your winter session average, they are included in the calculation of your graduating average (all senior-level Commerce courses) to determine eligibility for Honours standing. Furthermore, if your future plans include additional studies, some graduate programs may consider all undergraduate grades as the basis of admission. Keep in mind that regardless of when you took a course, the final mark will appear on your official UBC transcript.

 Continuation and Promotion
+
 Academic evaluations for continuation and promotion
+
 Each year during the month of May, the Undergraduate Office (UGO) reviews your academic progress and calculates your winter session average based on all courses taken from September to April to determine if you have successfully completed:
+
 continuation requirements to remain in the program
+
 course requirements for promotion to the next year level
+
 This is a weighted average, taking course credit values into consideration, and does include any failing grades. If you participate in a study abroad and exchange program during the winter session, grades earned on exchange will be included in the calculation. Courses taken during the summer session (May to August) are not included in the winter session average.
+
 Your winter session average is also used to determine:
+
 eligibility for the Dean's Honour Roll
+
 assignment of scholarships
+
 your registration access date for the next winter session
+
 Calculating a weighted average
+
 When calculating your average, you must take the credit values of your courses into consideration. Your one-credit COMM 202 course will have less weight than your three-credit COMM 293 course. Not sure how to calculate a weighted average? Input your anticipated/final grades into our weighted average calculator to see if you're on track to meet continuation requirements.
+
 Weighted average calculator
+
 Your academic success is important to us!
+
 In addition to year-end academic evaluations, we also conduct mid-session checks after December exams to provide assistance and resources to students who may be struggling in their studies. If you have concerns about your academic progress, we strongly encourage you to meet with an academic advisor in the UGO and take advantage of academic coaching services in the CLC.

 Continuation and promotion requirements by year
+
 Continuation in the BCom program
+
 A winter session average of ≥60% based on all courses attempted from September to April is required to continue in the program at all year levels. This is a weighted average calculated from your final course grades and their corresponding course credit values; it will include any failed courses. If you participate in a study abroad and exchange program during the winter session, grades earned on exchange will be included in the calculation.
+
 If your winter session average falls below 60%, you will be considered to have failed the year and will be required to discontinue your studies at UBC for a period of at least one year. Decimals are not rounded (i.e., a winter session average of 59.9% would be a failed year). Courses taken during the summer session (May to August) are not included in the winter session average.
+
 Promotion requirements
+
 BCom program requirements have changed in recent years, so when reviewing your promotion requirements,
+
 take careful note of when and at what year level you entered the program so that you're referring to the requirements that apply to you
+
 .
+
 For example, if you are currently a Year 2 (continuing or transfer), Year 3 (continuing or transfer) or Year 4 BCom student, please follow the degree requirements listed in the second tab labelled "Entry in 2021W and prior". The 'Entry in 2022W and onwards' tab is only for direct entry Year 1 students starting the BCom program for the first time in 2022W.

 Unsatisfactory performance

 If your winter session average falls below 60% at any year level, you will be considered to have failed the year and will be required to discontinue your studies at UBC for a period of at least one year. Decimals are not rounded (i.e., a winter session average of 59.9% would be a failed year). Instructions concerning eligibility for readmission to the program will be provided to students at the time they are required to discontinue. Notifications will be sent via email and letter mail in early June.
+
 Note: If you are an international student, this may have an impact on your legal status in Canada and study permit. If you have questions about the impact on your ability to stay in Canada, study permit, please refer to
+
 students.ubc.ca/international-student-guide
+
 .
+
 If you have additional questions or would like to discuss your options/next steps, we encourage you to seek advising from an International Student Advisor/ Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant available at International Student Advising in the UBC Life Building or contacting them at 604.822.5021 or
+
 isa@students.ubc.ca
+
 .
+
 Students who return to UBC Sauder and fail the year a second time, whether in repeating a year or in a later year, will be required to withdraw permanently. Readmission in such cases is normally not granted.

 VIDEO: How to find your elective requirements
+
 Watch this video to learn how to find the elective requirements applicable to your program.
+
 Plan your electives early and carefully
+
 When you're planning which electives to take and when to take them, be mindful of prerequisites, co-requisites, and course restrictions. Some senior-level electives (300 or 400-level) may only be taken in Year 3 or 4 and require junior-level prerequisites (100 or 200-level). There are also some courses which do not count for credit in the BCom program (see below).
+
 Meet with an advisor if you have questions about your elective requirements
+
 What are non-Commerce electives?
+
 Non-Commerce electives include courses in subject areas other than Commerce. Psychology, political science, international relations, economics, science, languages, or any other areas that interest you, are all excellent choices.
+
 Organizational Behaviour and Human Resources courses with a prefix of COHR cannot be counted as non-Commerce electives.
+
 Which electives don't count for credit in the BCom program?
+
 The following are courses that do not count for credit in the BCom program because they duplicate other Commerce courses that you are required to take.

 Exams
+
 Before your exams, read the UBC exam guidelines to learn what and what not to bring and how to conduct yourself during your exam session.
+
 UBC exam guidelines
+
 Please note that once you have started an exam, the grade you earn will stand. You will not be given another opportunity to increase your mark.
+
 Midterms
+
 Most Commerce midterm exams are coordinated by the Undergraduate Office (UGO) and held in the evening. Other exams may be scheduled by individual instructors during class time. Check with your instructor if you have questions.
+
 Commerce midterm exam schedule
+
 Please note that this calendar only includes midterm examinations scheduled by the UBC Sauder Undergraduate Office on behalf of Commerce instructors. It may not include COMM and COHR exams scheduled directly by instructors. Please confirm times and locations in your course outlines or with your instructors. Should any discrepancies in dates exist between this calendar and information listed in the official course outline, the course outline information will prevail.
+
 Midterm conflicts with a scheduled class or another exam
+
 If your COMM, COHR, COMR, or COEC midterm exam conflicts with the regularly scheduled class time of another course, you must report the conflict to your instructor administering the exam and the Undergraduate Office as soon as you are aware of the conflict, but at the very latest, two weeks prior to the exam sitting. In this situation, you are expected to attend your class. The Undergraduate Office will work with your instructor to make alternate arrangements for you to take the exam.
+
 If two of your midterms are scheduled at the same time and neither is scheduled during class time, report the conflict to both instructors and the Undergraduate Office as soon as you are aware of the conflict, but at the very latest, two weeks prior to the exam sitting. If neither instructor is able to provide an alternate exam time, the Undergraduate Office will work with your instructors to make alternate arrangements for you to take both exams.
+
 Notify the Undergraduate Office of a midterm conflict by emailing
+
 bcomquestions@sauder.ubc.ca
+
 with the subject line "Midterm conflict". In the message, please include your full name, student number, and details of the conflict (courses, instructors, dates, times, etc.).
+
 Midterm accommodations for students registered with the Centre for Accessibility
+
 If an advisor from the
+
 Centre for Accessibility
+
 (formerly known as Access and Diversity or A & D) has provided you with a letter of accommodation, be sure to complete the following at the start of the term per the instructions they have provided to you:
+
 1. Provide an electronic or hard copy of your letter of accommodation to each instructor/course administrator.
+
 2. Arrange a meeting with your instructors/course administrators to discuss your accommodations.
+
 Any requests for accommodated exams will be scheduled by the Centre for Accessibility.
+
 The Centre for Accessibility uses an
+
 online exam reservation system for requesting accommodated exam sittings
+
 ; it is not used for requesting exam sittings that are arranged directly by your instructor or the UGO. Requests must be submitted at least one week in advance for all midterms. Late requests will not be accommodated.
+
 What do I do if I miss an exam?
+
 Sometimes unanticipated events or circumstances can affect your ability to complete your academic responsibilities. You may be eligible for academic concession if your circumstances fall within certain categories. An academic concession is an allowance for you to make up missed coursework or an exam at a later date or by alternate means.
+
 Academic concession
+
 Final exams
+
 Final exams for the winter session are held in December (Term 1) and in April (Term 2). Exams for the summer session may be held during the last scheduled class or the week following the end of classes.
+
 Release of final exam schedule
+
 The final exam schedule for the winter session is available online in October for Term 1 courses and in February for Term 2 courses. Exams during the summer session are scheduled midway through each term.
+
 Log in to the Student Service Centre (SSC)
+
 to access your personal schedule.
+
 Final exam start time and attendance
+
 Please refer to
+
 Student Conduct during Examinations
+
 on UBC’s policy on exam start time and attendance. It is also recommended that you familiarize yourself with your instructor’s exam instructions to ensure you are properly prepared for their exams.
+
 Final exam conflicts
+
 You should contact your instructors as soon as possible to determine whether an alternate writing time is available. If neither instructor can accommodate a different exam time, you need to complete the Daytime Exam Clash form available from Enrolment Services in Brock Hall. Enrolment Services will arrange for you to write the examinations back-to-back on the original examination date, under supervision.
+
 Exam hardships
+
 An
+
 exam hardship
+
 is when you have three final exams scheduled within a 24-hour period. If the third exam falls on the 25th hour, it is not considered a hardship. For example, if the first exam is on Monday at 8:30am, the second exam is at 3:30pm, and the third exam is on Tuesday at 8:30am, there is no official hardship because the third exam starts just after the 24-hour period expires.
+
 If you face an exam hardship, you will be given an alternative exam date for the second exam. Contact the instructor of your second exam no later than one month prior to the scheduled exam date for courses in the winter session and no later than two weeks prior to the scheduled exam date for courses in the summer session. If the exam is for a Commerce course, your instructor may redirect you to the
+
 Undergraduate Office
+
 to report the hardship.
+
 Final exam accommodations for students registered with the Centre for Accessibility
+
 If an advisor from the Centre for Accessibility has provided you with a letter of accommodation, be sure to complete the following at the start of the term per the instructions they have provided to you:
+
 1. Provide an electronic or hard copy of your letter of accommodation to each instructor/course administrator.
+
 2. Arrange a meeting with your instructors/course administrators to discuss your accommodations.
+
 Any requests for accommodated exams will be scheduled by the Centre for Accessibility.
+
 The Centre for Accessibility uses an
+
 online exam reservation system for requesting accommodated exam sittings
+
 ; it is not used for requesting exam sittings that are arranged directly by your instructor or the UGO. Requests for final exams must be submitted at least one week in advance of the start of the formal examination period. Late requests will not be accommodated.
+
 Do not make travel plans until you know your exam schedule
+
 Do not make travel arrangements or personal commitments until the exam schedule has been published or you have confirmed your final exam date with your instructor. Resulting conflicts will not merit academic concession.

 Marketing
+
 A core function in most companies, marketing concerns itself with promoting, selling and distributing a product and service to customers.
+
 Am I the right fit for this option?
+
 The marketing curriculum is designed to provide you with a comprehensive background in contemporary marketing and the environmental forces affecting the marketing activities of the organization. You’ll look at the social and psychological determinants of consumer behaviour and use analytical tools to study economics and statistics. Plus, you’ll gain experience by taking part in projects that involve organizations from the greater Vancouver area.
+
 It helps to be comfortable working with cross-functional teams, and you’ll require great communication skills, an ability to take the initiative and integrate both qualitative and quantitative information. Creativity and analytical skills are huge assets too.

 International Business

 International Business
+
 International Business has become a catch-phrase for any business activity that crosses national and international borders. With rapid globalization, both private and public businesses find themselves faced with international, linguistic and cultural challenges.
+
 With the addition of the
+
 new International Business (IB) concentration
+
 in September 2021, the International Business option will be discontinued. Students who started Year 1 in 2020W will be the last cohort eligible to complete the option. Current IB option students can choose to complete the IB concentration instead, but they cannot complete both. Any eligible students planning to complete the option must apply to the option by July 31, 2021.
+
 Am I the right fit for this option?
+
 If you’re interested in learning about new cultures and different languages, you will thrive in the International Business (IB) option. It’s a great way to challenge preconceived notions and critically evaluate yourself and your environment.
+
 International Business option requirements
+
 International Business is completed as a double option. You need to first register in one of the other ten options as your primary specialization and submit an application to be admitted to IB as your secondary option. The IB language and international studies requirements will count towards your elective credits. Double counting between your primary option and IB is not permitted. A maximum of six credits may be double counted between IB and a minor.
+
 Requirements

+
 IB acceptable language course list
+
 Students completing Chinese, Cantonese or Japanese as their IB language should refer to the Asian Studies course renumbering document for changes to course numbers as of 2016 Summer.

 Operations and Logistics

 Operations and Logistics
+
 Every organization either manufactures a product, or provides a service, or both. "Operations" refers to the set of business processes that produce the product or service. "Logistics" refers to the set of business processes that procure inputs and distribute the finished product or service to the customer.
+
 An efficient and responsive business process is critical to optimize workflow and improve the organization’s competitiveness for success. Operations and logistics is about helping organizations create, deliver, and provide products and services better. It can mean lower expenses, higher quality, more sustainability, better alignment with customer needs, and increased efficiency. Since operations is about understanding and improving processes, the framework and tools are transferable and applicable to business processes throughout the organization.
+
 Am I the right fit for this option?
+
 Strong communication and interpersonal skills are essential for this career track. Ideally you’ll be efficient in project management with sharp negotiation skills and an entrepreneurial outlook. It also helps to be proficient in a second language.
+
 You’ll receive training in transport economics and management, government investment and regulatory programs affecting transportation and utilities, and business logistics. We recommend that you use electives to gain complimentary knowledge in related fields such as marketing, finance, and quantitative methods.

 Global Supply Chain and Logistics Management
+
 The Global Supply Chain and Logistics Management (Global SCLM) option is a specialized joint exchange program between the UBC Sauder School of Business, Copenhagen Business School (CBS) and Chinese University of Hong Kong in Shenzhen (CUHK SZ). With increasing demand for graduates trained in supply chain and logistics management, the program leverages the strengths of all three institutions in this area.
+
 My Global SCLM experience didn’t just teach me how supply chain management operates on a global scale. I harvested life-long friendships from three cities, a closer grasp of culture’s role in molding local and national business environments, and a deeper understanding of where my passion and growth can drive strategic changes.

 The Global Supply Chain and Logistics Management
 specialization was truly unique in that it offered an
 opportunity to travel (29 countries and counting), make
 friends around the world, and learn at three top universities.

 Entrepreneurship
+
 Entrepreneurship
+
 Entrepreneurship involves disruptive thinking and action. Entrepreneurial thinking and methods are relevant not only to the creation of new ventures, but also to helping grow or fundamentally change existing companies. Corporate innovators or intra-preneurs work with the same skillset as traditional entrepreneurs who start new ventures.
+
 Am I the right fit for this option?
+
 This is a very applied and experiential program, building on solid conceptual foundations. Topics of study include the economic drivers of innovation and new ventures, financial models, creative thinking, and problem solving. In New Venture Design, the capstone course, students from the UBC Sauder School of Business, Applied Science and other faculties work in interdisciplinary teams to design a venture, build a prototype and develop the business model required to raise funding and possibly launch the venture.
+
 To be successful in this option, you need to:
+
 have a curiosity about human nature, competition, and how things could be improved via disruptive approaches
+
 combine methodical ways of working with an ability to deal with ambiguity and messy, incomplete data
+
 be a team player with a strong work ethic and internal drive to excel
+
 learn from failure and experiments
+
 Why Entrepreneurship?
+
 Senior students describe how and why they chose this option.
+
 Still undecided about Entrepreneurship? Try COMM 280
+
 COMM 280 is our introductory entrepreneurship course that you can take for elective credit in Year 2 or 3. It's not a requirement for the Entrepreneurship option, but it's a great preview of what you can expect. You'll have an opportunity to explore your entrepreneurial potential by applying key concepts to a personal portfolio focused on your own innovative ventures.

 Double Options
+
 Double Options
+
 Pursuing a double option
+
 You can only be officially registered in
+
 one
+
 option, with the exception of International Business with your primary option; however, you may complete courses in another option and count them toward your elective requirements.
+
 Courses cannot be double counted between options. For example, if you are pursuing a double option in Marketing and Operations and Logistics, COMM 414 can be taken to fulfill requirements for one of the two options, but not both.
+
 Students who started Year 1 in 2020W will be the last cohort eligible to complete
+
 International Business (IB) as a secondary option
+
 . With the addition of the
+
 new International Business (IB) concentration
+
 in September 2021, the International Business option will be discontinued.
+
 Possible second options
+
 Students cannot complete a second option in Finance or General Business Management. However, there is usually limited space in Accounting, Business Technology Management, Marketing, Organizational Behaviour and Human Resources, Real Estate, and Operations and Logistics.
+
 Limited course availability
+
 Because the majority of seats in each option course are allocated to students officially in that option, availability for non-option students is very limited. Students who wish to complete a second option can often only access available seats in these courses starting in Year 4. This means that you may need to stay for an extra term or year to complete all the courses required for your second option as many of the Year 4 option courses have Year 3 prerequisites.
+
 If you're planning to complete a second option, it's up to you to register yourself in any requirements for that option.
+
 You'll only be eligible to register in general seats for other options, if any are available.
+
 Often general seats are taken by Year 4 students who register before Year 3 students. Therefore, if you’re attempting to complete a second option you may need to extend your studies to successfully register in and complete all required courses.
+
 Recognition of a double option
+
 If by graduation you have completed the requirements for two options, you may request for both options to be recorded on your transcript. Be aware that General Business Management cannot be completed with another option other than International Business
+
 (only eligible to students who started Year 1 in 2020W and have applied for the IB option before July 31, 2021)
+
 . Should you manage to complete three options, only two (of your choice) will be noted on your transcript.
+
 Declaring a second option, minor, or concentration
+
 Once the graduation application deadline has passed, the Undergraduate Office will send instructions to all applicants for how to affirm their expected completion of a second option, minor, or concentration, if applicable. Please ensure you submit your most up-to-date minor forms before obtaining your degree. 
 
 At the time of graduation, completion of a second option, minor, or concentration will be noted on your transcript.

 Eligibility and Registration
+
 Is this Early Start to the Finance Option a good pathway for me?
+
 If you’re interested in pursuing a career in the capital markets, the Early Start to the Finance Option provides early access to advanced finance courses in Years 2 and 3. This option pathway is a good fit if you have:
+
 The capacity to take on an extremely heavy/challenging course load in BOTH Years 2 and 3, while maintaining a high academic average.
+
 Strong quantitative, problem solving, and analytical skills.
+
 An exceptional work ethic.
+
 Excellent time management skills.
+
 Strong teamwork and interpersonal skills.
+
 Research skills.
+
 Will I still be eligible to apply to the Early Start to the Finance Option if I can’t complete one or more of COMM 190, COMM 293, COMM 295, or COMM 298 in Term 1?
+
 In order to be eligible for the Early Start to the Finance Option, you must have all of COMM 190, COMM 293, COMM 295 and COMM 298 completed before the start of Term 2. If you have deferred standing (i.e., SD) for any of these courses at the end of Term 1, you will not be eligible for the Early Start to the Finance Option. Instead, you can still choose the
+
 Finance option
+
 after completing Year 2. Please note that selection of the Finance option requires a competitive GPA (
+
 see option selection criteria
+
 ).
+
 Can I retake any of COMM 190, COMM 293, COMM 295, and COMM 298 if my grades were less than the required minimums?
+
 We will only consider grades from your first attempt at the required courses to determine your eligibility for admission to the Early Start. Appeals on the basis of extenuating circumstances will not be accepted. Remember, you can still choose the
+
 Finance option
+
 after completing Year 2. Please note that selection of the Finance option requires a competitive GPA (
+
 see option selection criteria
+
 ).

 What if I register for the Term 1 section of COMM 298 and decide that I no longer want to pursue the Early Start to the Finance Option?
+
 If you decide that you no longer want to pursue the Early Start to the option before the start of Term 1, we encourage you to switch yourself to a section of COMM 298 in Term 2, if there are seats available. This may allow another student to register in Term 1 so that they may be eligible to apply to the option. If you decide that you no longer want to pursue the Early Start to the option while completing COMM 298 in Term 1, it is not necessary to submit Part Two of the Early Start application.
+
 Can I take COMM 271 Introduction to Capital Markets and still be eligible for the Early Start to the Finance Option?
+
 Yes. Admission to COMM 271 is also by application (
+
 see details
+
 ). If you are admitted to COMM 271, keep in mind that the course is scheduled in Term 1 of the winter session during which you will also be taking all of COMM 293, COMM 295, and COMM 298 (and possibly COMM 190/290 if you are a transfer student). If you are a direct entry student who is planning to apply for a seat in COMM 271, you may consider taking COMM 293 and/or COMM 295 during the summer to reduce your Term 1 course load.
+
 One advantage to taking COMM 271—if you are admitted to the course—is that it may help to you determine if a career in capital markets is the right fit for you.
+
 You could also complete COMM 271 and start the Finance option in Year 3 or complete COMM 271 and pursue a different option.
+
 Admission
+
 Once I register myself in a Term 1 section of COMM 298, how do I submit Part One of the application?
+
 The link to the application will be provided by email to all Year 2 students registered in a Term 1 section of COMM 298 after all students have had an opportunity to register (distribution date and application deadline are still to be determined).
+
 Is the 76% minimum average requirement based on only COMM 190, COMM 293, COMM 295, and COMM 298 or does it include other courses?
+
 The 76% minimum average requirement for consideration of admission to the Early Start to Finance Option includes only COMM 190, COMM 293, COMM 295, and COMM 298 (in addition to the individual course minimums listed under Admission above).
+
 If you are not admitted to the Early Start and plan to start the Finance option in Year 3, selection of Finance requires a competitive GPA based on your Year 2 winter session average of all courses taken from September to April (
+
 see option selection criteria
+
 ).
+
 If I meet the academic minimums, will admission be considered by my average or would admission be more heavily based on my written application?
+
 Both components are equally important and will be considered when determining admission.
+
 If the number of applicants to the Early Start to the Finance Option exceeds the limited number of seats available, does that mean that achievement of the academic minimums required for admission may not guarantee admission?
+
 Yes. If there is high demand for the Early Start to the Finance Option, actual admission averages may be higher depending on the pool of applicants.
+
 When will I know if I’ve been admitted?
+
 Applicants to the Early Start to the Finance Option will be notified of decisions at the start of Term 2 in January.
+
 Can I still join the Finance option even if I wasn’t admitted to the Early Start to the Finance Option?
+
 Yes. Students who are not admitted to the Early Start to the Finance Option can still choose the
+
 Finance option
+
 after completing Year 2. Please note that selection of the Finance option requires a competitive GPA (
+
 see option selection criteria
+
 ).
+
 Option Requirements
+
 Are the option requirements the same for the Early Start to the Finance option and the traditional Finance option?
+
 Yes. Course requirements are the same regardless of when you start the option.
+
 What are the promotion requirements for the Early Start to the Finance Option?
+
 Within the Early Start to the Finance Option, progression from year to year still requires completion of the same
+
 promotion requirements
+
 . Participants should expect to complete a Commerce-intensive schedule of core and option courses in Years 2 and 3, deferring most electives to Year 4.
+
 Can I still complete a double option if I’m admitted to the Early Start?
+
 Yes. It is still possible to complete a second option. Courses taken toward a second option count as Commerce electives toward your
+
 elective degree requirements
+
 . Completion of a second option may require you to extend the duration of your studies.
+
 Learn more about double options.
+
 If I’m in the Combined Major in Business and Computer Science (BUCS), am I eligible to complete the Early Start to Finance as a second option and use these credits toward elective requirements?
+
 No. The BUCS program itself is intensive with limited room for electives. It is not structured to be completed with a second option.
+
 Can I take Finance as a minor if I am not sure about taking Finance as my major?
+
 Finance is an option (i.e., specialization) rather than a major. All BCom students have the same major: Commerce. The BCom program is not structured to allow for completion of a minor in an area of business. For BComs, a minor is typically 30 credits of coursework in a subject area outside of business, of which at least 18 credits are at the 300/400-level.
+
 If you are planning to take 300/400-level Finance courses, it is recommended that you pursue Finance as your primary option. Because there is high demand for Finance courses, there are very few seats open to non-Finance students (many Finance courses don’t have any).
+
 If I finish the option in Year 3, can I graduate early?
+
 While the Early Start does allow you to complete the Finance option in Year 3, you must also complete all of your other
+
 BCom program requirements
+
 to graduate. Your earliest opportunity to complete your required Year 4 capstone course (i.e., one of COMM 491, COMM 497, COMM 498, etc.) will be during the summer session after Year 3.
+
 If you start the BCom program with advanced credit, complete a full course load each winter session, and complete courses during the summer, you may be able to finish your program in less than four years.
+
 Will my academic transcript indicate that I completed the Early Start to the Finance Option?
+
 No. Completion of the Finance option will be denoted on all academic transcripts in the same way for all Finance students regardless of when they started the option.
+
 Career Preparation and Employment Opportunities
+
 What extracurricular activities should I do if I want to pursue a career in capital markets?
+
 You should be ready to commit most, if not all, of your extracurricular time to the following:
+
 Building knowledge on the different roles and skillsets needed to stand out to employers in the capital markets.
+
 Reviewing online resources, attending company information sessions, and setting up informational coffee chats with BCom Career Managers, senior students, alumni, and finance professionals. It is recommended that you start doing this in the summer after Year 1 and throughout Year 2.
+
 Getting involved with relevant clubs, events, and competitions to build your financial knowledge and practice the interpersonal and technical skills needed to succeed in the capital markets.
+
 Practicing self-reflection as new knowledge is gained, to build a solid understanding of your individual “why” for pursuing particular finance roles. The answer to this foundational question is necessary to help you navigate the opportunities in finance you will be exposed to. It is also asked during internship interviews and often referred to in informational interviews.
+
 What are the benefits of completing the Early Start to the Finance Option versus the traditional Finance option?
+
 Career path engagement
+
 The Early Start to the Finance option allows you to be identified earlier for specific campus recruitment events from the major banks, pension plan companies, and investment firms. This allows for connection opportunities that can benefit you when you search for relevant summer internships. It can also provide you with a better understanding of the types of roles and positions that fall under the large capital markets umbrella. Organizations are eager to identify, and are starting to target, students interested in finance earlier in their academic careers.
+
 Early exposure to relevant knowledge and skillsets
+
 Along with giving you early exposure to the fundamental concepts of corporate finance, the Early Start to the Finance Option provides you with the opportunity to practice relevant Excel skills in COMM 370 in Year 2.
+
 Additionally, you have an opportunity to take all of your advanced finance courses by the end of Year 3, which allows you to focus on specific areas in the capital markets and better prepare for interviews.
+
 Do my grades matter once I’m admitted to the Early Start to the Finance Option?
+
 If you apply to summer internships in capital markets, companies will consider your academic transcript during the screening process as a performance indicator so it’s important that you continue to maintain good grades. Your continued research and self-reflection in this area and involvement in relevant extracurricular activities will also help you to stand out as a strong candidate.
+
 Does taking the Early Start to the Finance option guarantee I will find an internship in the capital markets?
+
 No, there are no guarantees that students taking the Early Start to the Finance Option will land an internship in the capital markets or any other area of finance. This is due to the high level of competition for these internships.
+
 Whether or not you are in the Early Start to Finance Option, students who have landed internships exhibit both a strong dedication to their academics and a commitment to relevant extracurricular activities. It’s important to keep in mind, even this combination of academics and commitment does not guarantee success in landing an internship.
+
 Will not getting into the Early Start to the Finance Option prevent me from landing an internship in the capital markets?
+
 No. Students who do not take the Early Start to the Finance Option can still land internships in the capital markets. Students from various options, not just Finance and Accounting, have successfully landed internships in the capital markets.
+

 Option Waitlist
+
 Eligibility for the waitlist
+
 If you're unable to register for the option you want when you first register for Year 3 courses in June, and your Year 2 average is no more than 3% lower than the
+
 predetermined cutoff for that option
+
 , you may add yourself to the option waitlist (only add yourself to the waitlist for Finance or Accounting - you have access to switch yourself to any of the other options without cutoffs).
+
 It's possible to switch your option in Year 4, but since the priority for option switches goes to Year 3 students, space is often limited.
+
 All option switch requests are subject to a rigorous evaluation of your academic performance, including:
+
 your Year 2 winter session average
+
 your average in quantitative COMM 29x courses (regardless of when you took them)
+
 your grade(s) in any prerequisite courses for your preferred option (
+
 see list
+
 )
+
 If successful, you may need to extend your BCom studies for additional terms to fulfill all requirements.
+
 Registration from the waitlist
+
 If it's possible to switch you to your option of choice, you will be registered in available sections of the required courses for that option and deregistered from any courses required for your former option. Everyone who adds themselves to the waitlist in July will be notified of their status in early August.
+
 The waitlist and double options
+
 If you're trying to complete a second option or register for courses in a second option, you will not be reviewed for an option switch.
+
 Add yourself to the option waitlist
+
 Waitlist open dates
+
 The waitlist opens in July during or after the week of Year 3 registration. If any options still have space after the initial registration period, students will be added from the waitlist in order of their Year 2 winter session average (September to April).
+
 If there is space available in any of the competitive options, the option waitlist will open in late November or December for students finishing Year 2 requirements in Term 1. Once Term 1 grades have been posted, students on the waitlist will be evaluated for promotion to Year 3 and assessed for their option choice based on a combination of their previous winter session average and their performance in Year 2 requirements taken in Term 1 of the current session. Please note that the option waitlist may not open in November/December if the competitive options do not have space to accommodate any additional students.

+
 When to register for your option
+
 You are required to select your option when you register for your Year 3 courses. Your registration date is determined by your previous winter session average (courses taken from September to April). The higher your average, the earlier your registration date and time will be and the better your chances to select both your first choice of option, and the courses and sections in which you want to register. In early June you will receive an email from UBC Enrolment Services to notify you when your specific registration date and time are posted on the Student Service Centre.
+
 How to register for your option
+
 When your registration opens:
+
 log in to the
+
 Student Service Centre
-.
+
+.
+
 navigate to the
+
 Course Schedule
+
 under
+
 Registration
-.
+
+.
+
 select
+
 Browse
+
 on the top menu and choose
+
 Specializations
+
 from the dropdown list.
+
 select
+
 BCom
+
 from the list of degree programs.
+
 from the list of BCom specializations, choose your option and click on the
+
 Add Spec
+
 button.
+
 Option prerequisites
+
 You must complete
+
 all prerequisite courses
+
 to be able to register in option courses. If you are selecting the Finance option, you must have already completed COMM 298. To be
+
 promotable to Year 4
+
 , you must complete at least six credits of the required third year courses for your option. You can be officially registered in
+
 one
+
 option only.
+
 Option cutoffs
+
 Finance and Accounting are both competitive options for which demand exceeds capacity. Once the required courses for an option has been filled, we will close registration for the option. To learn more about option cutoff averages, please review the
+
 eligibility requirements for BCom options
-.
+
+.
+
 If you did not achieve the cut-off average, but were within 3% of it, register yourself in your second choice and then
+
 add yourself to the option waitlist for your first choice
+
 . We will accommodate requests from the waitlist, in order from the highest average, if space permits. Cutoff averages may change for subsequent sessions depending on course availability and demand.
+
 Changes underway for 2024W and how to declare your pathway (i.e., register for your option)
+
 Last updated December 13, 2022
+
 Starting 2024W, there will be changes to the way students register for their option in Year 3.
+
 GPA cut-offs will no longer be used. This early notification allows students to plan courses accordingly.
+
 Students must achieve a minimum grade of 60% in each of COMM 293 and COMM 294 to self-declare the
+
 Accounting option
-.
+
+.
+
 Students must achieve a minimum grade of 67% in each of COMM 190 (previously numbered COMM 290), COMM 191 (previously numbered COMM 291), COMM 293, COMM 294, COMM 295, and COMM 298 to self-declare the
+
 Finance option
-.
+
+.
+
 Students who do not achieve
+
 minimum grades
+
 in one or more
+
 of the courses required for
+
 Accounting or Finance
+
 may still be considered
+
 by adding themselves to a waitlist
+
 (details will be provided when
+
 2024W registration information is distributed)
-.
+
+.
+
 Students on
+
 the waitlist will be
+
 prioritized
+
 based on previous academic performance
-.
+
+.
+
 They will be
+
 added to
+
 their
+
 preferred option
+
 if
+
 space permits
-.
+
+.
+
 Performance in prerequisite courses is us
+
 ually indicative of performance in option courses so we recommend that if you have not achieved the minimum grades
+
 required for self-declaration of an option, then
+
 you should con
+
 sider
+
 choosing another
+
 option
+
 instead

 Your GPA is your Year 2 winter session average calculated using all courses taken from September to April. Note that UBC will be transitioning to a new student information system from the current Student Service Centre in 2024. It's expected that students will begin to use the new system for course registration starting in 2024W. In the new system, eligibility for the Finance and Accounting options will be determined by minimum grades in select courses rather than by Year 2 winter session average (i.e., Year 2 GPA).
+

+
 As of 2022W: COMM 290 renumbered COMM 190; COMM 291 renumbered COMM 191; COMM 292 renumbered COMM 192. The newly numbered courses are equivalent to their predecessors.

+
 Students who do not achieve mnimum grades in one or more of the required courses may still be considered for the option (see

 Taking Courses Outside of UBC
+
 Taking Courses Outside of UBC
+
 UBC provides a wide range of courses for your academic pursuits. As a UBC BCom student, you are expected to complete your degree requirements at UBC through on-campus or
+
 UBC Distance Learning
+
 courses, or on
+
 Go Global exchange
+
 . The Undergraduate Office is here to provide you with the information you need to help you achieve your personal and academic goals.
+
 In certain circumstances, students may be eligible for/granted a Letter of Permission to take courses outside of UBC. Before submitting an online form to request an LOP, please read the following information carefully.
+
 Letters of Permission (LOP)
+
 In certain circumstances you can be granted permission to study outside of UBC with a Letter of Permission (LOP). Without an approved LOP, your transfer credits may not to be counted towards your UBC degree.
+
 You do NOT need a LOP if you:
+
 are taking courses at a partner university through
+
 Go Global Exchange
+
 have cross-campus registration at UBCO. For this you will need to complete a
+
 Cross-Campus Registration form
+
 are leaving UBC to complete your degree elsewhere
+
 do not intend to apply credit completed towards your Bachelor of Commerce degree
+
 You need a LOP for:
+
 The Explore French language program
+
 City Studio
+
 Semester in Dialogue
+
 To participate in a for-credit program endorsed by Arts Indigenous Student Advising (AISA): BCOM students interested in these programs should still connect with an academic advisor at the UGO for more information and are expected to request the LOP through the UGO
+
 To participate in a for-credit unique experience not available through UBC
+
 To participate in a for-credit program or Field School recognized by a UBC Department
+
 In certain exceptional circumstances to meet core BCom degree requirements
+
 You are eligible for a LOP if:
+
 You are in good academic standing
+
 Students who are on academic probation or who had a failed session in the current or prior academic year (September to August) will not be approved for an LOP.
+
 In order to understand if exceptions can be made to this, please connect with an Academic Advisor at the UGO.
+
 You are a returning student
+
 First-year students will not be granted LOPs in their first Winter session at UBC.
+
 You have enough transfer credits left
+
 The residency requirement states that a minimum of 50% of your degree requirements (61 credits) must be completed while registered as a student in the BCom program. Go Global exchange credits are eligible towards these minimums.
+
 Note that the maximum number of transfer credits that can be obtained through LOPs is 12 credits.
+
 The course is a lower-level elective
+
 All required COMM courses (and CPSC courses for BUCS students), and upper-level elective courses must be completed at UBC.
+
 If the course is offered at UBC a LOP request will not be approved.
+
 The institution is accredited
+
 Because transfer credit is only granted for courses that can be considered equivalent to something that UBC would offer, credit will only be granted for academic study at recognized post-secondary institutions.
+
 The course is considered a unique opportunity to enhance your degree
+
 This rationale must be provided in writing. Note that LOP requests based on proximity to your home, or for financial reasons such as a lower tuition cost, will not be supported.
+
 Submit a LOP request
+
 Requests are reviewed individually and you will be notified with a decision by email. The process to evaluate an LOP request can take several weeks, so please factor this into your planning.
+
 Other things to note:
+
 Recommendations:
+
 a course recommendation by a professor or division does not guarantee that an LOP will be approved.
+
 Admission to the other institution:
+
 an LOP issued by UBC does not guarantee admission as a visiting student to another institution. It is your responsibility to ensure that you meet all entry requirements as a visiting student at the host institution.
+
 Concurrent registration:
+
 Concurrent registration at both UBC and other post-secondary institutions is not recommended.
+
 Scheduling conflicts:
+
 if you decide to pursue a course at another institution while taking courses at UBC we expect that you will prioritize fulfilling academic responsibilities at UBC. Students are expected to make note of any scheduling conflicts between coursework and/or exams at UBC and the other institution. UBC will not support academic concession requests based on such conflicts.
+
 Expiration of the LOP:
+
 An LOP can be used only for the Term that it is granted. For example, if you have an LOP approved for Winter Session Term 1 and decide to take the course in Winter Session Term 2, you will need to reapply for a new LOP.
+
 Applying the transfer credits to your degree:
+
 to be eligible for transfer credits, BCom students must have approval from an Academic Advisor in the UGO before registering at another institution. Please review

+
 How do I request it?
+
 Consider carefully whether you will take Term 1, Term 2 or both terms away from studies*. Check your
+
 program requirements
+
 , tuition refund deadlines and any
+
 immigration implications
+
 thoroughly.
+
 It is strongly encouraged that you talk to an academic advisor before withdrawing from your courses. Book an online advising appointment at
+
 mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/ugo#bookadvising
+
 or visit our
+
 virtual office
+
 .
+
 Withdraw from all courses in Term 1, Term 2 or both terms on or before the
+
 last day to drop courses with a “W
+
 ”
+
 standing.
+

+
 Request form
+
 Letters are issued within 5 business days to the email address listed on your SSC account. The leave will not appear on your transcript. Include the authorized leave letter with future IRCC applications as needed.
+

+
 study permit
+
 and
+
 post-graduation work permit
+
 obligations. For more information, please read
+
 students.ubc.ca/international-student-guide/immigration/taking-time-away-school-international
+
 and the
+
 FAQs for international students
+
 .
+
 How do I order an official transcript?
+

 BCom Course Planning Worksheets
+
 BCom Course Planning Worksheets
+
 Keep track of your BCom degree requirements and credits with your personalized course planning worksheet
+
 Please note that Degree Navigator is not available to BCom students via the SSC.
+
 How to use the worksheet
+
 Read the eligibility for each set of worksheets and download the correct Excel file (below).
+
 In the file, select the tab that corresponds to the year you started in the program (direct entry in Year 1 or transfer to Year 2 or 3) and your primary (or intended) specialization.
+
 In the unlocked columns, insert the number of credits for each course you have completed and are currently registered in. You can also type in specific electives you took or are taking in the
+
 Electives
+
 section of the worksheet.
+
 You will see the courses you need to complete in the
+
 Course
+
 column of the worksheet.
+
 Save a copy of the worksheet and continue to update it as you progress through the program.
+
 Your course planning worksheet can be used to:
+
 Unofficially confirm you are on track to complete degree requirements.
+
 Track registered courses against your program requirements to ensure your current registration will result in meeting
+
 promotion requirements
+
 as planned.
+
 Plan hypothetical registration scenarios for future sessions, including possible options, concentrations, and minors.
+
 Your course planning worksheet will not:
+
 Update automatically when you make changes to your registration on the Student Service Centre (SSC).
+
 Guarantee course registration in particular courses.
+
 Update requirements automatically if the requirements of your program change.
+
 Show the number of credits and specific courses you need for a double option, concentration, or minor. Courses that you take to complete these designations will count toward your elective requirements.
+
 Calculate your degree completion date. You can estimate this date by using the worksheet to determine how many credits you have remaining and then planning which courses to take in each future term.
+
 You are responsible for understanding your
+
 BCom program requirements
+
 and ensuring that you record your credits accurately in your course planning worksheet. Any questions should be addressed to the Undergraduate Office's academic advising team.
+
 Eligibility
+
 If you entered the program directly to Year 1 in September 2021 or earlier; transferred as a Year 2 student in September 2022 or earlier, or transferred as a Year 3 student in September 2023 or earlier, please use this course planning worksheet.
+
 BCom course planning worksheet #1
+
 If you entered the program directly to Year 1 in September 2022 or later, or transferred as a Year 2 student in September 2023, please use this course planning worksheet.
+
 BCom course planning worksheet #2
+
 Selecting the correct course planning worksheet
+
 Which course planning worksheet should I use?
+
 Choose the worksheet that corresponds to the year you started in the program (direct entry in Year 1 or transfer to Year 2 or 3) and your primary (or intended) specialization.
+
 If you started directly as a Year 1 student in September 2022, use the second set of worksheets and select the option you intend to pursue.
+
 What is the difference between the first course planning worksheet for students who started the program in Year 1 (direct entry) versus students who transferred into the program?
+
 Students who started in Year 1 are required to complete
+
 COMM 101 Business Fundamentals
+
 . Students who transferred to Year 2 or Year 3 are not required to take COMM 101 and instead must take an additional elective.
+
 Can I use the course planning worksheet if I completed a degree prior to entering the BCom program?
+
 No. Please refer to the Prior Degree Assessment provided to you when you were admitted to the BCom program.

 COMM 295 will only be available in Term 1 of the 2023 Summer Session. There will be
+
 no
+
 offering of COMM 295 during Term 2.
+
 COMM 396 will be replacing COMM 390 starting 2023 Summer. When testing your worklist, adding COMM 396 may produce a warning, but if you have the prerequisite listed in the Section Comments, you will be able to register successfully. Please carefully read the Section Comments for a list of acceptable prerequistes.

 Registration dates

 will open during the last week of February 2023.

 You will receive an email from Enrolment Services in mid-February directing you to check the Student Service Centre for the exact date and time when your registration will open. You may pay your tuition deposit at that time as well (the deposit is not required if you are not taking summer courses).
+
 As most summer courses are only six weeks in duration, be aware of earlier withdrawal dates and the refund schedule before you drop any courses. Note that the registration deposit is non-refundable and cannot be transferred to another session.

 Summer credit limits

 Your registration is limited to six credits per term and 12 credits total for the summer session.

 Available Commerce courses

 If you're looking at the year-level restrictions for courses you're planning to take during the summer, you may be wondering if you'll be eligible to register. Before summer registration starts, we decrease the year level restriction of Commerce courses offered to allow students to register in summer courses for the year level they will be promoted to in May once they have successfully completed their winter session courses.

+
 Frequently asked questions about taking summer courses
+
 I'm in Year 1. Will I be able to register in Commerce courses restricted to students in Year 2?
+
 Yes! For summer registration, we decrease the year level of the course restrictions to allow students to register in summer courses for the year level they will be promoted to in May once they have successfully completed their Term 2 winter session courses.
+
 What should I do if I can't register in a course that I want?
+
 Keep checking enrolment and register yourself when a seat becomes available. There is often a lot of movement in courses at the start of term.
+
 The online registration assistance form will not be available for summer registration. If you are graduating in November and need assistance to register in a required Commerce course, please contact the Undergraduate Office.
+
 Do grades in summer courses matter?
+
 Yes! While grades for summer courses are not included in the calculation of your winter session average for each year, a summer session average will be calculated and included on your academic transcript with the final grades for all of your summer courses.
+
 Additionally, any senior-level Commerce courses (300 or 400-level) will be included in the calculation of your graduating average to determine eligibility for Honours standing.
+
 Furthermore, if your future plans include additional studies, some graduate programs, depending on the institution, may consider all undergraduate grades as the basis of admission.
+
 I'm taking summer courses to finish requirements in my current year. Will I be automatically assessed for continuation/promotion once my grades have been posted?
+
 No. Once your grades have been posted on the Student Service Centre, please contact the Undergraduate Office. An advisor will review your academic record and evaluate you for continuation/promotion in the BCom program.
+
 Am I eligible for a U-Pass if I'm taking summer courses?
+
 Eligibility for the
+
 U-Pass
+
 is determined by your continued registration. During the summer session, you will be charged the U-Pass fee on a monthly basis. For example, if you take a Term 2 course scheduled from July to August, you will be eligible and subsequently charged for a July and August U-Pass.

 Start with a plan
+
 Before you register, carefully review your degree requirements and make a plan (and a backup plan) that includes all of your required and elective courses. Think ahead beyond the current year to make sure that you're taking any prerequisites now for courses you wish to take in later years.
+
 Degree requirements
+
 On this page, learn:
+
 How to find your registration date
+
 How to pay your acceptance deposit (if new to UBC Sauder)
+
 How to pick your courses, build your worklists, and register
+
 How to manage your registration
+
 How your transfer credits will apply toward your degree requirements
+
 How a reduced course load can impact certain eligibilities
+
 Find your registration date
+
 UBC Enrolment Services will notify you of your specific registration date and time by email in June/July for the winter session and February for the summer session. Your winter session registration time is determined by your previous winter session average. Your summer session registration time is determined by your Term 1 average in the current winter session. The higher your average, the earlier your registration date and time will be.
+
 Registration dates
+
 Pay your acceptance deposit if new to UBC Sauder
+
 Your registration status will remain blocked until your registration opens. If you were newly admitted to UBC Sauder this year, you must pay your
+
 acceptance deposit
+
 before you’ll be able to register.
+
 Starting 2021 Winter Session, the registration deposit has been removed from most undergraduate degree programs.
+
 Pick your courses, build your worklists, and register
+
 Review your program requirements to see which courses to take
+
 and then log in to the
+
 Student Service Centre (SSC)
+
 to start building your worklists. Not sure how? Watch the video tutorials for detailed instructions.
+
 Registration video tutorials
+
 It’s your responsibility to arrange a conflict-free timetable. To help, we’ve broken it all down into simple steps for each year. You'll also receive registration instructions specific to your year by email at least one week before your registration date.
+
 Registering for Year 1
+
 Step 1 - Register in a standard timetable
+
 All new Year 1 students must register in an STT. Students within each STT will belong to a cohort of 25-30 students who share the same course schedule. Within these smaller groups, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to form meaningful connections with other students in your cohort and collaborate on team-based coursework. You‘ll find the full list of available STTs on the
+
 Student Service Centre course schedule website
-.
+
+.
+
 You cannot switch course sections or drop individual courses from your standard timetable. If you have
+
 advanced (first-year) credit
+
 for any courses within your STT, contact the
+
 UBC Sauder Undergraduate Office
+
 for assistance after you have registered. Do not attempt to drop these courses yourself as you may accidentally drop your entire STT and lose your place in it.
+
 All BCom students will take MATH 100 regardless of whether or not they completed Calculus 12 (or an equivalent course) in secondary school.
+
 If you're enrolled in the Combined Major in Business and Computer Science (BUCS), your STT will include MATH 101, however, it will not include your required Computer Science courses. After registering in your STT, you must register in CPSC 110 in Term 1 and CPSC 121 in Term 2. Refer to the
+
 BUCS program requirements
+
 for details.
+
 Note: Course registration for newly admitted Year 1 students ends on July 15. After July 15, you will lose your eligibility to register in the BCom program. If you receive your offer of admission after this date, you can register for courses until classes start.
+
 Step 2 - Register in a non-Commerce elective
+
 Register in 3 credits of electives in Term 1 or Term 2 (likely the alternate term to your COMM 196 course unless you have advanced credit for any courses within your STT). Choose non-Commerce electives that interest you or complement your career goals or work towards your program requirement. Keep in mind that the BCom program requires senior-level electives (courses numbered 3xx or 4xx) that you will take in Years 3 and 4 (or sooner). Some senior-level electives have prerequisites so plan your program accordingly (e.g., MATH 101 is a prerequisite for many senior-level ECON courses).
+
 Avoid taking non-Commerce electives that are not for credit in the BCom program. Confirm that the electives you have selected will count for credit in the BCom program by reviewing the not-for-credit tables at the bottom of the
+
 Elective requirements page
-.
+
+.
+
 Important:
+
 Pick an STT that will work with your other courses and commitments. Switching sections in STTs is not permitted.
+
 Registering for Year 2
+
 Step 1 - Register in core Commerce courses
+
 New to UBC Sauder in 2023W Year 2 students (transfer students from other faculties at UBC or other post-secondary institutions):
+
 Second year students do not register in a standard timetable for Year 2 courses. You must build your timetable by registering in each of the Year 2 requirements individually or through your worklist.
+
 Check the
+
 SSC
+
 to confirm the transfer credit you have received. You do not need to register in any courses for which you have already received credit. When planning your schedule, note that many Term 2 Commerce courses have prerequisites that must be successfully completed in Term 1 before attempting them.
+
 Note: Course registration for newly admitted Year 2 students ends on July 15. After July 15, you will lose your eligibility to register in the BCom program. If you receive your offer of admission after this date, you can register for courses until classes start.
+

 Continuing in 2023W Year 2 students (direct entry students who attended Year 1 at UBC Sauder):

 If you're enrolled in the Combined Major in Business and Computer Science (BUCS),
+
 review your requirements to plan your timetable
-.
+
+.
+
 Step 2 - Register in electives
+
 New Year 2 students:
+
 You will not have room in your schedule to register in any electives unless you have transfer credit for some of the required Year 1 and 2 Commerce courses or you choose to defer one or more required Year 2 Commerce courses to the subsequent summer session or Year 3.
+
 Be sure to check promotion requirements before deferring any courses.
+
 Continuing Year 2 students:
+
 Register in six credits of electives. See
+
 Electives page
+
 for program requirements
+
 Registering for Year 3
+
 Step 1 - Choose an option
+
 When your registration opens, you must
+
 choose your option
+
 prior to registering for your courses. To register for your option, you need to select the applicable specialization code on the SSC. Select the option and then click the
+
 ADD SPEC
+
 button.
+
 If you have already been admitted to the Co-op Program, you must use
+
 SWITCH SPEC
+
 to switch from Co-op to your option. You will be re-added to Co-op after your registration.
+
 Note that some options have
+
 cutoff averages and/or require that you complete all prerequisites
+
 before taking option courses. The Undergraduate Office (UGO) will verify that students declaring an option meet the option cut-off average to ensure readiness to succeed. If you do register in an option for which there is a cut-off and you do not meet the anticipated cut-off average as listed on the website, the UGO will contact you and will assist you in making changes to your option and your COMM/COHR course registration.
+
 If you’ve been selected for the Global Supply Chain and Logistics Management option, the UGO will add you to your option. You will receive further information about course registration prior to your registration date.
+
 If you were admitted to the Combined Major in Business and Computer Science (BUCS), you do not select an option. Visit
+
 Program requirements
+
 to learn more.
+
 Note: Course registration for newly admitted Year 3 students ends on July 15. After July 15, you will lose your eligibility to register in the BCom program. If you receive your offer of admission after this date, you can register for courses until classes start.
+
 Step 2 - Register in option courses
+
 Register in your required Year 3 option courses (6 to 9 credits varying by option). To be promotable to Year 4, you must complete at least 6 credits of the required third year courses for your option. For example, if you select the Accounting option, you should register in COMM 353 and COMM 354.
+

+
 If you're studying abroad in this year, do not register in any UBC courses during your exchange term(s); only register in courses for the term that you will be attending UBC. Go Global will register you in an exchange code to indicate that you are on exchange, which will trigger your tuition for the term and enable awards staff to review your eligibility for the Go Global International Learning Award. If you do register in any courses in the term(s) that you are scheduled to be on exchange, you will be dropped from these courses. If for any reason you do not go on exchange, the UGO will assist you to register in any required COMM/COHR courses.
+
 Registering for Year 4
+
 Step 1 - Register in your remaining option courses
+
 Step 2 - Register in any remaining Commerce core requirements from previous years that you have not yet completed

 to determine your remaining requirements. If you require assistance in determining your program requirements, please contact the
+
 UBC Sauder Undergraduate Office (UGO)
-.
+
+.
+
 If you’re completing the Combined Major in Business and Computer Science, please

+
 International exchange
+
 If you're studying abroad this year, do not register in any UBC courses during your exchange term(s); only register in courses for the term that you will be attending UBC. Go Global will register you in an exchange code to indicate that you are on exchange, which will trigger your tuition for the term and enable awards staff to review your eligibility for the Go Global International Learning Award. If you do register in any courses in the term(s) that you are scheduled to be on exchange, you will be dropped from these courses. If for any reason you do not go on exchange, the UGO will assist you to register in any required COMM/COHR courses.
+
 Register for both terms
+
 When your registration opens, register for both terms – winter Term 1 (September to December) and winter Term 2 (January to April), or summer Term 1 (May to June) and summer Term 2 (July to August). Courses fill up quickly, so don’t delay.
+
 Worklists and registered courses
+
 Don’t confuse your worklists with your registered classes!
+
 You must register for the courses in your worklist when your registration opens to officially be in them. If you make changes to your courses after you initially register, be sure that you're making changes to your registered course list and not one of your worklists.
+
 Manage your registration
+
 Add, drop, and switch sections in a course
+
 You can make changes to your registered courses without a withdrawal (W) standing on your transcript until the deadline posted on the course schedule. When making changes to your registration, be sure that you’re updating your list of registered courses and not just a worklist.
+
 Important:
+
 Review each course section’s withdrawal deadlines carefully. They vary depending on the duration and credit value of the course.
+
 Withdraw from a course with a W standing
+
 If you withdraw from a course after the first withdrawal deadline, a W standing will be noted on your transcript and refunds will be processed according to the
+
 tuition refund schedule
+
 . You can withdraw with a W standing until the second withdrawal date posted for the section on the course schedule. Beyond then, you cannot drop the course.
+
 Official course change dates
+
 If you need to withdraw from a course after the published deadline due to extenuating circumstances, speak with an advisor in the Undergraduate Office (UGO). A change to your registration after the second withdrawal deadline is an
+
 academic concession
+
 that requires approval from the UGO. Supporting documentation is required.
+
 Impacts of course withdrawal
+
 It is your responsibility to consider the possible impacts of a course withdrawal, and weigh the benefits and disadvantages before making a final decision.
+
 Any of the following may be affected by a course withdrawal:
+
 Your academic record
+
 You will receive a “W” standing on your academic record. A “W” standing is not included in the calculation of your overall average for the winter session.
+
 Tuition fees
+
 Tuition fees for courses with a “W” standing will be assessed according to the UBC
+
 tuition refund schedule
-.
+
+.
+
 Full-time status as an international student
+
 International students must actively pursue full-time studies in each winter session term to be eligible to apply for a Post-Graduation Work Permit after graduation. Consult the International Student Guide for details:
+
 students.ubc.ca/international-student-guide/immigration/immigration-impacts-withdrawing-courses
+
 students.ubc.ca/international-student-guide/immigration/ubc-definitions-immigration-purposes#full-time
+
 students.ubc.ca/career/career-resources/working-canada/post-graduation-work-permit
+
 If you have questions, we encourage you to connect with an advisor at International Student Advising:
+
 students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/international-student-advising
+
 Courses with prerequisites and option declaration
+
 A “W” standing may impact your eligibility to take sequenced courses (e.g., COMM 190 is a prerequisite to COMM 191—if you drop COMM 190 in Term 1, you cannot take COMM 191 in Term 2). Review course prerequisites on the
+
 Student Service Centre
+
 or the
+
 UBC Calendar
+
 . Prerequisite courses for option selection are listed on our
+
 Options webpage
-.
+
+.
+
 Promotion to the next year level and graduation
+
 A “W” standing may impact your eligibility for promotion. Before you withdraw from a course, carefully review
+
 promotion requirements
-.
+
+.
+
 If you are in your final year of studies, withdrawal from a course will delay your graduation if you need it to complete your degree requirements.
+
 Academic distinctions
+
 A “W’ standing may affect eligibility for
+
 Dean’s Honour Roll and Degree with Honours
-.
+
+.
+
 Varsity sports
+
 A “W” standing may impact your eligibility to participate in some Varsity sports or qualify for participation in some competitions. Contact
+
 student.varsity@ubc.ca
+
 for clarification of your requirements as a student athlete.
+
 Eligibility for funding
+
 Awards, scholarships, student loans, private health insurance, and other financial supports often require that you are registered in a minimum number of credits. A reduction in your total registered credits resulting from a withdrawal may affect your eligibility to access and retain these resources. Please contact your
+
 Enrolment Services advisor
+
 to better understand any impacts on student loans and awards.
+
 Postgraduate academic programs and employment
+
 Different institutions have different admissions criteria, so it’s important to refer to their published requirements. For most programs, it is unlikely that a “W” standing will have a significant impact on the evaluation of your application.
+
 Similarly, potential employers who request to see your academic transcript will likely be more interested in your courses that have final grades, than in any courses with “W” standings.
+
 A pattern of multiple withdrawals throughout your degree may be more closely scrutinized and solicit requests for an explanation.
+
 Anticipated absences
+
 If your ability to attend classes or complete coursework and assignments is severely affected or if you expect regular or prolonged absences, you should contact an Academic Advisor in the UGO to further discuss your case.
+
 Students with a disability or ongoing medical condition
+
 Students registered with the
+
 Centre for Accessibility (CFA
+
 ) should have their accommodation agreed upon at the beginning of the course between the student, CFA, and the instructor. Students who are not registered with CFA may wish to discuss their case with the centre or connect with an Academic Advisor in the UGO.
+
 If illness or disability related reasons interfere with your ability to attend classes or complete coursework and assignment, you should follow the indications provided by your instructor and submit a request for Academic Concession through the Undergraduate Office (UGO).
+
 Varsity athletes
+
 These students have a letter outlining their Varsity commitments sent to the instructor by UBC Athletics.
+
 Unanticipated absences
+
 If you face unexpected illness or unavoidable responsibilities that impact your ability to fulfil your academic responsibilities, you could be eligible for an academic concession.
+
 An academic concession acknowledges the circumstances a student faces that are outside of their control or expectation, and grants them eligibility for adjustments to help them complete their studies.
+
 Am I qualified for an academic concession?
+
 If your situation is related to an experience of sexual violence, you have the option of contacting UBC’s
+
 Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office (SVPRO)
+
 (604 822 1588) who can assist you with your academic concession.
+

 Credit/D/Fail grading policy
+
 The Credit/D/Fail grading policy allows you to take eligible elective courses and safely explore new and exciting subjects, earning a Credit, D, or Fail standing instead of a percentage grade on your academic transcript.
+
 Read more at the link below:
+
 More about Credit/D/Fail grading
+
 How does a 'W' affect my academic standing?
+
 Don’t be concerned about having a W standing on your transcript. It simply indicates that you withdrew from a course. Course withdrawals are not included in calculating your sessional or graduating averages. Remember though that you will not receive a full refund of your tuition past the first withdrawal deadline.
 
 (Please note if you're accessing resources that have credit requirements, a W may impact your eligibility.)
+
 Are you eligible to receive transfer credits from AP, IB, or A-Levels?
+
 If your high school studies included Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), or British-patterned education (A-Levels), you may be eligible to receive transfer credit that you can use toward your BCom degree requirements.
+
 Advanced Placement
+
 If you received a grade of 4 or better on approved Advanced Placement exams, UBC will grant you first-year credit. If you are granted credit for any of the following courses, you do not need to take them at UBC.

Depending on which course(s) are dropped, you may choose to take a reduced course load (that means fewer than 30 credits) or you may choose to register for additional non-Commerce electives. The choice is yours. Please review the information on this page carefully, including the
+

 Make arrangements to have your

 final official test results
+
 sent directly to UBC Undergraduate Admissions

 as soon as possible
+
 as it may take several weeks from when they are received for credit to be awarded. You may not see transfer credit on your student record until after you’ve registered for your courses. Course withdrawals will not be granted or backdated should any transfer credit be awarded after the course withdrawal deadline.
+
 Transfer credit will be applied toward your degree requirements automatically once it has been granted. You don't need to do anything to activate or use it.
+
 First-year credit tables
+
 Maintain your eligibility for student loans
+
 Government loans, grants, and interest-free status all require students to be enrolled in at least 60% (80% for Newfoundland loans) of a full-time course load in each term. Given the credit structure of the BCom program, the minimum number of credits you must be enrolled in varies at different year levels. Consult the course load guide at students.ubc.ca to ensure that you meet the requirements to maintain your funding. Note that eligibility to receive scholarships and to live in UBC residence is determined by separate registration criteria.
+
 Consult the course load guide
+
 Impacts of a reduced course load
+
 If you’re thinking about reducing your course load during the winter session (fewer than 30 credits), be mindful of commitments and considerations that require you to be registered in a minimum number of credits to maintain your eligibility.
+
 Are you meeting promotion requirements?
+
 To be promoted to the next year level, you must complete a set number of total credits. For example, to be promoted to Year 2, you must complete at least 24 credits. Eligible transfer credits are included in this total.
+
 Check your promotion requirements
+
 Have you received awards or funding?
+
 Many scholarships, awards, and bursaries stipulate that students are registered* in a minimum of 24 percentage-graded** credits in a winter session (September-April). Do you have a scholarship/award/bursary with this requirement? Do you want to maintain your eligibility for next year? Refer to your funding notification for details. If you have questions about your requirements, check with your

 UBC Sauder – HKU Dual Degree Program
+
 UBC Sauder – HKU Dual Degree Program
+
 The
+
 UBC Sauder-HKU Dual Degree is a four-year program in which you will spend two years in Vancouver and two years in Hong Kong, gaining a global business education, and graduating with two degrees: A Bachelor of Commerce from UBC Sauder and a Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Hong Kong. You must complete a total of 146 credits (145 credits for students who started in 2021W), a choice of five HKU majors, and one of nine UBC Sauder options in which to specialize.
+
 General program requirements
+
 Dual Degree students are expected to successfully complete first year of the University of Hong Kong undergraduate curriculum in order to come to UBC. All students follow the rules and regulations of the university they are attending at the time.
+
 You can choose to specialize in a different discipline at each university. For example, you can graduate from UBC Sauder with an option in Business Technology Management and graduate from HKU with a specialization in Finance. You may find that you want to pursue an option at UBC Sauder that complements your HKU major or one that is entirely different. It’s up to you to decide which study paths best suit your future goals and aspirations.
+
 We've mapped out the requirements of your Dual Degree program over a four-year period. Keep in mind that this is just a guide – you may want to join the Co-op program, take a term abroad on exchange, take some of your courses in a different sequence, or participate in one of many other co-curricular opportunities – any of which could take you on a slightly different learning path. That's okay! Just be aware of course prerequisites, co-requisites and restrictions, and promotion and continuation requirements when planning your program.
+
 If you complete university-level courses while in high school, you may be able to take fewer courses to complete your degree. Find out which Advanced Placement, British-patterned education, and International Baccalaureate courses are eligible for
+
 first-year credit at UBC
+
 . Be sure to speak with an Academic Advisor about applicable transfer credit.
+
 Keep in mind that you have six years to finish your degree requirements from the date that you were first admitted to the Dual Degree program.
+
 To see your program requirements, select the tab with the year level and session that you entered the program
+
 Your specific degree requirements will depend on when you were admitted.
+
 Be sure to refer to the correct requirements that apply to you by selecting the year level and session in which you entered the program
+
 . Keep in mind that you have six years to finish your degree requirements from the date that you were first admitted to the BCom program.
+
 Program advising
+
 If you're enrolled in the Dual Degree, our international programs advisor Ann Gilray can assist you with program planning.

 General Program Requirements

 We've mapped out the requirements of your BCom over a four-year period, allocating a full course load of 30/31 credits in each year. Keep in mind that this is just a guide – you may want to join the Co-op program, take a term abroad on exchange, or participate in one of many other co-curricular opportunities – any of which could take you on a slightly different learning path. That's okay! Just be aware of course prerequisites, co-requisites and restrictions, and promotion and continuation requirements when planning your program.
+
 To see your program requirements, select the tab with the year level and session that you entered the program
+
 Your specific degree requirements will depend on when you were admitted.

 Be sure to refer to the correct requirements that apply to you by selecting the year level and session in which you entered the program
+
 . Keep in mind that you have six years to finish your degree requirements from the date that you were first admitted to the BCom program.

 Although COMM 335 is a Year 4 requirement, we recommend that you take the course in Year 3 and instead take CPSC 320 in Year 4; COMM 335 is a prerequisite to many of the optional Business Technology Management courses you can choose from to fulfill other Year 4 requirements.
+
 17
+
 Choose course not taken in Year 3.
+
 18
+
 Formerly numbered COMM 486N.
+
 19
+
 As of May 2021, credit will be granted for only one of COMM 439 or CPSC 317.
+
 20
+
 As COMM 466 is a six-credit course, the additional three credits may be applied toward general elective requirements, or the COMM 49x requirement (three credits equivalent to COMM 497).
+
 21
+
 Admission to COMM 483 and COMM 466 are by application only. Three of the six credits from COMM 483 or COMM 466 may be used to satisfy the capstone requirement. Note, you may receive credit for only one of COMM 466 and COMM 497.
+
 22
+
 CPSC student directed seminars (CPSC 490) cannot be used to satisfy the CPSC 300 and 400-level course requirements.
+
 23
+
 See electives page for restrictions.
+
 24
+
 Excludes COMM 437. See list of
+
 Business Technology Management courses
+
 available to fulfill this requirement.
+
 25
+
 COMM 486Y - Cybersecurity
+
 may be taken to fulfill this requirement.
+
 Graduation
+
 Once you have fulfilled your BCom degree requirements, it’s time to
+
 apply to graduate
+
 . Note that if you achieve a winter session average below 60% in your final year, you will be permitted to graduate, however, a notation of ‘Failed Year’ will appear on your academic transcript for that session.
+
 Continuation in the BCom program
+
 If you have not completed all of your requirements for graduation, you may still continue in the next winter session, remaining in Year 4, provided your winter session average is greater than or equal to 60% on all courses attempted from September to April. You must achieve the minimum 60% continuation requirement by the end of the current winter session in April. When planning your studies, keep in mind that you must complete all of your degree requirements within six years of entering the program to be conferred a Bachelor of Commerce from UBC.

 Program Requirements
+
 While most of our students complete the general BCom program, an increasing number of students choose to pursue the Combined Major in Business and Computer Science program.
+
 Regardless of your program, knowing your requirements early and drafting your course plan in advance will allow you the flexibility to engage in many of the co-curricular opportunities available to you. When reviewing the requirements, take careful note of
+
 when
+
 and at what year level you entered the program
+
 so that you're following the correct set.
+

 Academic evaluations for continuation and promotion
+
 Each year during the month of May, the Undergraduate Office (UGO) reviews your academic progress and calculates your winter session average based on all courses taken from September to April to determine if you have successfully completed (1) continuation requirements to remain in the program, and  (2) course requirements for promotion to the next year level. If your winter session  average falls below 60% at any year level, you will be considered to have failed the year and will be required to discontinue your studies at UBC for a period of at least one year. Decimals are not rounded (i.e., a winter session average of 59.9% would be a failed year).

 Co-op Program
+
 Frequently Asked Questions
+
 Will the Co-op Program place me into a job?
+
 No. As a Co-op student, you are responsible for your own job search in order to find employment during your time in the Co-op program.
+
 The Co-op team and the Hari B. Varshney Business Career Centre work with local, national, and international employers to post valuable jobs with a variety of growth opportunities for Co-op students. You will be able to apply for these opportunities on COOL, our online job portal, or do your own self-directed job search. You will also be supported by the Co-op team before, during, and after your search.
+
 What are the fees of the UBC Sauder Co-op program?
+
 In addition to University of British Columbia fees, students are required to pay fees associated with the UBC Sauder Co-op program:
+
 Co-op students pay a
+
 one-time workshop and administration fee
+
 , payable upon acceptance into the UBC Sauder Co-op Program
+
 Course tuition fees
+
 are paid during each Co-op work term, payable to UBC
+

+
 Co-op Fees (Per Term)
+
 Total Amount
+
 Workshop and Administration Fee
+
 $272*x 1 terms
+
 $272
+
 Co-op Course Fee
+
 $838*x 3 terms
+
 $2,514
+
 *These fees are for 2023-24, and are subject to change, as per
+
 UBC tuition guidelines
+
 Why am I paying Co-op fees?
+
 This is not a job placement fee.
+
 These fees help us to offset the costs of running the Co-op program and allow us to offer services that help students throughout their journey, including:
+
 Advising and preparing you for your Co-op work terms through mandatory pre-employment workshops, networking events, mock interviews, and more
+
 One-on-one office hours for assistance during your job searches with our Co-op Managers
+
 Support provided before and during your work term, such as site visits, newsletters, job recommendation emails, directory of past Co-ops and hiring timelines
+
 Building relationships with reputable employers who post new and recurring positions with the program
+
 What is the Co-op course fee for?
+
 Each time you participate in a Co-op work term, you will be registered in a Co-op work term course (COMM 380/381/480 or 481) and pay the course tuition fees
+
 Registration in the Co-op work term course is mandatory and maintains your full-time student status with UBC
+
 You will receive non-academic credits per Co-op work term course. Co-op work term courses do not count towards your academic degree requirements
+
 What do Co-op fees cost for an international student?
+
 International students pay the same amount as domestic students, and with a Co-op work permit, you can work full-time year-round
+
 Tuition is reviewed annually by the UBC Board of Governors. In recent years, tuition increases have been 2% annually
+
 Visit the
+
 UBC Calendar
+
 for the latest fee information
+
 If you have any questions about fees please contact your
+
 Enrolment Services Advisor
+
 Why would you want to maintain full-time student status at UBC Sauder?
+
 There are commitments and considerations that require students to be registered as a full-time student to maintain eligibility (e.g. loans, scholarships, housing, study permit/work permit, etc.).
+
 If you are an international student, you must be enrolled as a full-time student for immigration purposes. Find out more
+
 here
+
 If you have any questions about full-time student status, please contact a
+
 UGO Academic Advisor
+
 If you have any questions about fees please contact your
+
 Enrolment Services Advisor
+
 Does Co-op count for academic credit?
+
 Students on a Co-op work term are registered into a Co-op course, which allows you to maintain full-time student status that term. However, Co-op courses are non-academic credits that do not count towards graduation. A Co-op work term does not replace or add academic course credits for that term.
+
 Am I graded on a work-term?
+
 Co-op courses are Pass/Fail only. You must complete all work term deliverables on time in order to pass the course. This includes:
+
 Submitting your work term learning objectives
+
 Completing a site visit with your Co-op Manager
+
 Submitting a high quality end of term Work Term Report, Program Evaluation, Self Evaluation, and updated resume
+
 Having your supervisor complete their Employer Evaluation
+
 Can part-time jobs count as Co-op?
+
 No. Only full-time positions that are a minimum of 420 hours can count for Co-op (e.g., 35 hours per week for 12 weeks or any other combination of the required hours in the 4-month work term period).
+
 Am I still eligible for student loans and scholarships while in Co-op?
+
 For details about student loans or your scholarship status while in the Co-op program, see
+
 special circumstances for students receiving awards
+
 .
+
 Can I apply to the UBC Sauder Co-op Program anytime throughout the year
+
 ?
+
 No. You can only apply to the UBC Sauder Co-op Program during the intake period which occurs once a year in September. If you miss the intake period, you can apply again the following year if you still meet all eligibility requirements.
+
 No exceptions will be made.
+
 Can I do an international work term?
+
 Our students are welcome to explore opportunities outside of Canada for their Co-op work terms. If you do so, be mindful that there might be regulations outside of our control that may preclude you from doing your Co-op work term in a specific country. Before you apply for a role in a foreign jurisdiction, it is important to do basic research of the required documents to submit and conditions for you to work there. One example is France, where all internships and Co-op work terms require “convention de stage”, which is currently not a document that UBC Sauder provides to our students.
+
 Can I go on exchange while in the Co-op Program?
+
 Yes, you can still go on exchange for an academic term, while in the Co-op Program! Speak to your Co-op Manager about your Co-op work and study plan and connect with representatives from
+
 Go Global
+
 to learn more.

 Meet your Co-op Team
+
 Phil Seo
+
 Associate Director, UBC Sauder Co-op Program | phil.seo@sauder.ubc.ca
+
 About Phil:
+
 I’m a proud Sauder Co-op alumnus who enjoyed doing work terms in Ottawa and Vancouver, and exchange studies in Korea. I went on to work for Deloitte Consulting, get my MBA from Berkeley, and then work for Vancity Credit Union. In 2019, I pursued my long-term passion of helping Sauder students and am excited to lead the Co-op Program.
+
 Best piece of career advice Phil ever received:
+
 Do your research, but at the end of the day, trust your gut to make big decisions.
+
 Fun fact:
+
 I raced on the national reality TV show “The Amazing Race Canada: Heroes Edition”!
+
 Kimberly Chang
+
 Manager, UBC Sauder Co-op Program | kimberly.chang@sauder.ubc.ca
+
 About Kim:
+
 It wasn’t too long ago that I was roaming the halls of Sauder. I had such a transformative experience that I decided to come back to help students with their own professional development. After graduating from the Accounting option, I worked in Audit at KPMG Vancouver, obtained my CPA designation, and later joined Nature’s Path Foods as an Operations Accountant. Formerly a Sauder student and now a young professional, I understand the challenges you may face when starting your career. I look forward to helping you with your journey through the Co-op Program!
+
 Best piece of career advice Kim ever received:
+
 Focus on the process, rather than the results.
+
 Fun fact:
+
 The highlights of my Sauder experience include teaching abroad in Kenya with Sauder Social Entrepreneurship and in Poland with AIESEC UBC.
+
 Lea Gashi
+
 Manager, UBC Sauder Co-op Program | lea.gashi@sauder.ubc.ca
+
 About Lea:
+
 Co-op is an opportunity for you to explore and learn more about yourself
+
 and various career paths
+
 ! My passion for supporting youth throughout their career
+
 s
+
 stemmed from my previous role at KPMG as a Campus Talent Attraction Specialist, where I thrived
+
 in making meaningful connections
+
 . I spent a number of years in Human Resources at Porter Airlines Inc. working in talent acquisition, advising and events. I completed my BA at the University of Toronto in 2016, and as a young professional, I understand the various hats
+
 many
+
 student
+
 s
+
 wear throughout their education
+
 and career
+
 .
+
 I look forward to being a part of your unique Co-op journey and support
+
 ing
+
 you throughout the process.
+
 Best piece of career advice Lea ever received:
+
 Live your life an
+
 d
+
 not someone else’s – stay true to
+
 yourself
+
 ,
+
 your
+
 goals, motivators and values.
+
 Fun fact:
+
 I owned and operated a Balkan-themed cocktail bar in Toronto!

 I look forward to helping you navigate through all of the challenges and aspects of your journey through the Co-op Program!  My passion for coaching undergraduate business students with their professional development and career management is evidenced in over 5 years of career advising and coaching, most recently at SFU’s Beedie School of Business and prior to that at McGill University’s Desautels Faculty of Management. I completed my BA in Honours Economics at The University of Western Ontario and prior to working in higher education, I spent two years as an Analyst with Merrill Lynch in Toronto and was fortunate to train in New York City at Merrill’s global headquarters.
+
 Best piece of career advice Michael ever received:
+
 It might sound cliché, but pursue your passions!
+
 Fun fact:
+
 I make home-made food for my English Bulldog, Jack!

 How do Co-op Managers help?
+
 "The Co-op Managers at Sauder provide on-going support in helping students successfully find co-op jobs that align with their interests. As an accounting student going through CPA recruit, my Co-op Manager spent many hours talking with me about the different opportunities in industry and public practice. Thanks to my Co-op Manager for her feedback and advice on my job applications, I have developed greater confidence in searching for my next work term!" - Jason N., Accounting Co-op Student

 Although my background includes working in Marketing and Sales, my real passion has always been working with students to provide career coaching.

 How Career Strategists Help
+
 "The Career [Strategists] at UBC Sauder provided me with the support and confidence I needed to kick-start my career. The one-on-one coaching appointments allowed for a tailored experience where they continuously worked alongside me to help tackle whatever career-related obstacles I was facing. With the support through follow ups, resources, and connections, I knew they cared about me both as a student and as a future business leader." - Cheryl Y., OBHR Student

 Learn the do’s and don’ts of negotiating offers
+
 Your hard work has paid off, and
+
 you’ve received a job offer!
+
 While this is undoubtedly exciting, it’s best to avoid accepting job offers immediately. Give yourself time to
+
 consider whether the offer is really what you want
+
 . And if it isn’t, there may be room to negotiate.
+
 But how do you go about negotiating? Review the Hari B. Varshney Business Career Centre's (BCC) below resources for guidance.

 Enhance your applications and leave a lasting impression on employers
+

+
 When applying for jobs, it’s important to remember that hiring managers often get swamped with applications.
+
 To help your resumes and cover letters stand out,
+
 tailor EVERY resume and cover letter
+
 you submit
+
 to the particular:
+
 Role
+
 Industry
+
 Organization
+
 Otherwise, your documents may get lost in a sea of generic applications
+
 , and you won’t have another chance to express your interest and suitability for the job.
+
 How to get started?
+
 Remember,
+
 you don’t have to tackle this challenge alone
+
 !
+
 The Hari B. Varshney Business Career Centre (BCC) provides BComs free access to various resources to help you craft resumes and cover letters that get results.
+
 Resume Resources
+
 Learn how to make your resume stand out so it lands in the “yes” pile.
+

+
 Cover Letter Resources
+

 Toronto is an exciting place to be when you begin your career! With so many corporate national offices-including Labatt-being based in the Greater Toronto Area, students and recent graduates benefit from the larger pool of jobs available to them and the exciting career paths these opportunities lead to. Working at national office in Toronto will [also] lead to quicker progression in your career!

 Bianca Ciccarelli, Western Canada People, Manager, Labatt Breweries
+
 Did you know?
+
 According to the
+
 Economist Intelligence Unit’s (EIU)
+
 2023 Global Liveability Index on the most livable major cities in the world,
+
 Vancouver ranks #5
+
 while
+
 Toronto ranks #9
+
 .
+
 Option-specific Insights
+
 Most Canadian
+
 consulting
+
 and
+
 finance
+
 opportunities are in Toronto, which is Canada’s largest financial hub
+
 Most
+
 new grad leadership programs in business analytics
+
 take place outside of B.C., mainly in Toronto—however, there are opportunities in Vancouver
+
 According to CPABC, it's estimated that by 2029 BC will create almost 40,000 new
+
 accounting
+
 jobs
+
 Due to the cost of living and availability of talent,
+
 marketing
+
 salaries can vary between cities in Canada. Generally, adjust average base salaries as follows:
+
 Vancouver: +3%
+
 Toronto: +3.2%
+
 International Students Working in Canada
+
 If you’re an international student, whether or not you intend on staying in Canada after graduation, getting work experience in Canada can help you advance your career.
+
 Attending
+
 Launch Your Career in Canada
+
 is a great starting point while you are at UBC. This annual networking experience, open only to UBC international students, is dedicated to supporting their career development. Launch Your Career in Canada provides an opportunity to hear from and connect with alumni and industry professionals each year.
+
 Work Permits
+
 As an international student, you can do several types of work in Canada, including on and off-campus employment, Co-op work terms, and jobs after graduation. Some require specific work permits
+
 Refer to
+
 UBC Student Services' Working in Canada
+
 page for information about the different work permits required to work in Canada and additional related information. You can also get more information from the
+
 Government of Canada's Immigration and Citizenship website
+
 .
+
 Questions?
+
 Connect with
+
 International Student Advising
+
 for questions related to immigration, health insurance, and life as an international student in Canada.
+
 Working Abroad
+
 Working abroad builds
+
 independence, initiative, and adaptability
+
 – important traits employers always value.
+
 An international work placement will help you get work experience directly related to your field. It will also enhance your global perspective and professional network.
+
 Eligibility & documentation requirements
+
 Most intentional positions require at least a bachelor's degree, but there are still many options if you haven’t completed your studies.
+
 Research the required documents and conditions to work in foreign jurisdictions before applying
+
 . For example, if you want to work in France, you should know that all Co-op work terms and internships require a “convention de stage,” which is currently not a document that UBC Sauder provides students.
+
 If you want to work abroad, you’ll need to apply for a work permit from the country where you want to work. This can take time to organize, so plan. Contact the appropriate embassy or consulate to find out what’s required. If you have dual citizenship (e.g., a parent or grandparent born in your destination country), contact the embassy and begin the paperwork as early as possible.
+
 SWAP
+
 is an excellent resource if you want to pay for help arranging visas and/or locating work overseas.

 Job hunting? Tips to help you find what you’re looking for
+
 Job searching can feel like a daunting task.
+
 There are tons of job postings on many different websites, and when you apply online, it can seem like your resume vanishes into the abyss.
+
 Finding jobs that match you is
+
 more than just replying to random online job ads
+
 . To get started and save time, it’s helpful to:
+
 Do some
+
 introspection
+
 to know what you’re looking for
+
 Find opportunities that
+
 match your skills and experience
+
 Understand the
+
 recruitment cycles
+
 of employers that hire new grads
+
 You don’t have to go it alone
+
 on your job search. Explore the Hari B. Varshney Business Career Centre’s (BCC) resources and services to get support.
+
 Ways to get started & build your experience
+
 Self-guided Career Toolkits designed for UBC Sauder students
+
 Understanding what you’re looking for and why is a great starting point because it will help narrow your search. It will also help you explain why you want a specific role when you’re interviewed.
+
 See the resources below for help with introspection to guide a successful job search and recommended ways to find jobs.
+
 Job Search Toolkit
+
 Searching takes time and planning, whether you’re looking for an internship, Co-op work term, part-time or full-time role.
+
 Read this toolkit to learn where to research, how to factor in your goals and timeline, how employers hire, how to approach online job boards, and what jobs to apply for.
+
 Access on COOL
+
 Role Alignment Toolkit
+
 As you search for jobs, it’s helpful to know if the jobs you're finding align with your career goals and if you align with the job’s requirements.
+
 This toolkit highlights which industries require certain grades, what to think about for locations, and when professional designations are needed.
+
 Access on COOL
+
 Work & Volunteer Experience Toolkit
+
 Some job descriptions have lengthy requirements that seem impossible to meet, especially for those early in their careers.
+
 This Toolkit goes over the 70% rule (you don’t need to meet all the requirements!) and how to find experience while you study.
+
 Access on COOL
+
 Access additional Career Toolkits on other career-related topics like resumes, cover letters, and interviews on
+
 COOL
+
 .
+
 CWL login is required to access all Toolkits.

 Where to find jobs

 What you need to know about recruitment cycles
+
 Not all companies and industries use the same recruiting cycles. Consider these factors when searching for jobs online and considering various industries and companies.
+
 Large companies
+
 (e.g., Deloitte, KPMG, Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo, IBM, TELUS) typically:
+
 Have structured recruitment programs and cycles
+
 Recruit in the fall for graduate positions
+
 Recruit in the fall and spring for summer positions
+
 Start posting jobs on COOL in August or September
+
 Hire Co-op students
+
 Offer new graduate training programs
+
 Smaller companies
+
 (e.g., Coast Capital Savings, Whistler Blackcomb, Bench Accounting, Alida, Major Tom, Concert Properties) typically:
+
 Recruit just in time throughout the year as positions become available
+
 Hire Co-op students when necessary
+
 Do not offer formalized graduate training programs
+
 Job application tips
+
 Don’t wait for the deadline - apply to the posting ASAP.
+
 Employers may choose to close the posting sooner than the published deadline
+
 .
+
 Tailor your cover letter and resume to each posting.
+

 Beyond your UBC BCom
+
 As you explore the graduate school path, it's important to first
+
 determine why you want to go to grad school
+
 .
+
 Maybe you’re interested in
+
 practicing law,
+
 specializing
+
 in a specific business discipline,
+
 or
+
 getting an MBA
+
 to help you climb the corporate ladder. Or, maybe you’d like to do
+
 academic research
+
 .
+
 Whatever your reason, to choose the right program and school, you need to consider your ultimate career goals. For help defining and creating goals, explore the Business Career Centre's (BCC)
+
 Career Goals Toolkit on COOL
+
 .
+
 Applying to grad school
+
 Grad school applications have many parts. They typically require:
+
 A transcript
+
 A standardized test score
+
 Letters of recommendation
+
 A personal admissions essay
+
 You’ve probably heard of standardized tests such as the
+
 GMAT
+
 (
+
 Graduate Management Admissions Test)
+
 ,
+
 GRE
+
 (
+
 Graduate Record Examination)
+
 , or
+
 LSAT
+
 (
+
 Law School Admission Test)
+
 . They’re a way to compare students from different universities with different grading standards.
+
 Whatever test you plan to take, familiarize yourself with the test format and investigate research library resources and online forums for study tips.
+
 Take the standardized test early
+
 to avoid missing your application deadline.
+
 While standardized tests provide a numerical score,
+
 letters of recommendation
+
 and
+
 admissions essays
+
 provide more insights into the applicant's personal, professional, and academic background. That’s why good references from your professors and/or employers are important. If you’re serious about pursuing grad studies, remember to
+
 start building relationships early
+
 and maintain them
+
 .

 MBA programs
+
 A Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree can help
+
 advance your career
+
 and
+
 open doors
+
 to new opportunities. You’ll typically need an undergraduate degree and several years of work experience before doing an MBA.
+
 Prospective MBA students take the
+
 GMAT
+
 , which measures their verbal, quantitative, and analytical skills. There are a number of test sessions each year. Some business schools also accept the
+
 GRE
+
 test.
+
 Wondering where to apply? Explore the latest
+
 MBA program rankings
+
 and discover the
+
 UBC MBA
+
 .
+
 Specialized master's degree programs
+
 Alternatives to an MBA include specialized master's programs (SMP), which generally focus on a particular business area. These are growing in popularity worldwide.
+
 Typically, these programs require applicants to have a bachelor's degree and can take
+
 less than a year to two years to complete
+
 . There are specialized business master's degrees in a variety of fields, including:
+
 Data analytics (for example, the
+
 UBC MBAN
+
 )
+
 Human resources
+
 Finance
+
 Operations management
+
 Marketing
+
 Prospective students will likely need to take the GMAT or GRE for these programs. Learn more about
+
 specialized business master's programs
+
 and see how a
+
 specialized master's compares to an MBA
+
 .
+
 Law schools
+
 Are you considering a law degree? There's no "best" pre-law undergraduate degree, but know that you'll need to do well in courses that involve synthesizing information, writing, and analytical reasoning.
+
 The
+
 Law School Admission Test (LSAT)
+
 is a standardized test administered four times yearly, assessing prospective law students' reading, writing, and logical reasoning abilities. Visit the
+
 Law School Admission Council (L
+
 SAC) website
+
 for LSAT registration information. Some next steps include:
+
 Deciding if
+
 law school
+
 is right for you
+
 Learning more about
+
 LSAT preparation

+

+
 Where does SEAT data come from?
+
 The alumni job data comes directly from UBC Sauder graduates within 6 months of graduation.
+
 All UBC Sauder graduates
+
 , including MBAs and Master of Business Analytics grads, are asked to complete the SEAT survey within 6 months of finishing their program. This means you can also see details of where Masters-level UBC Sauder grads land in SEAT.
+
 When it’s time for you to report your post-grad job placement data, you’ll be able to pay it forward and help future BComs with your job information.
+
 All individual responses in SEAT are anonymous, kept confidential, and reported in aggregate form only.
+
 How your information is used:
+
 1. Responses are
+
 anonymous
+
 and
+
 reported in aggregate form only
+
 . All individual responses will be kept
+
 confidential and reported anonymously
+
 in aggregate form. Individual information may only be used to verify your status as a BCom graduate.
+
 2.
+
 For accreditation purposes, all UBC Sauder graduates are asked to complete the SEAT questionnaire
+
 . The UBC Sauder School of Business is required to collect employment information on every graduating student in accordance with our accreditations with
+
 AACSB
+
 (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business). These accreditations are very important for the School and our reputation globally. The Business Career Centre reports this data at an aggregate level.
+
 3. This information
+
 contributes to a number of key initiatives across UBC Sauder
+
 that
+
 benefit current and future BComs
+
 .
+
 4. The Business Career Centre provides current and future BCom students with access to anonymous and aggregate salary and employment data to help them with their career decisions. The Undergraduate Programs Office uses this information to promote the UBC BCom program to prospective students.
+
 5. If you report your status as “Seeking Employment”, a Career Strategist may contact you via email to offer support.
+
 6. The employment data will be consolidated and shared in aggregate for marketing purposes and in the data on the SEAT Research Tool.
+
 Personal information will not be
+
 shared.

 Going on exchange is an excellent opportunity to gain first-hand experience of another country's business practices, language, and culture. You’ll make new friends, valuable connections, and life-long memories.
+
 Getting started
+

+
 Review eligibility requirements.

+
 Eligibility and course requirements

 To go on exchange, you must have attended UBC for one year and have completed Year 2 of the BCom program. While on exchange, you'll take a full-time course load, for which you can earn up to 15 UBC credits per term (a maximum of two courses can be option or concentration requirements). You’ll pay 15 credits worth of tuition to UBC per term.
+

+
 Commerce Course Equivalency Chart
+
 for a list of exchange courses that have been approved as UBC Sauder course equivalents. Courses taken on exchange that are not equivalent to UBC courses are assigned as Commerce or non-Commerce elective credits. The year level and type of credit assigned is dependent on the course taken.

 Frequently asked questions about exchange
+
 What is a commerce-specific exchange?
+
 The UBC Sauder School of Business has partnerships with 69 schools in 30 countries around the world. Going on exchange to one of our partner schools will enable you to take business courses to use toward your degree. As well, spaces available at our partner schools are for BCom students only. You are able to participate in university-wide exchanges, but should be aware that access to business courses may be limited.
+
 When can I go on exchange?
+
 You must have attended UBC for one year and have completed Year 2 of the BCom program. Most exchanges are available for one or two terms during the academic year, while some also offer summer programs. You must return to UBC after an exchange for at least one term, which includes at least one required course, prior to graduation, however, co-op students may be exempted from this rule and other cases may be considered (to go on exchange in your final term you must save 9-15 credits of required electives to take on exchange).
+
 Are there courses I can't take on exchange?
+
 A maximum of 50% of your option or concentration courses can be taken on exchange. For most options and concentrations this means two courses from each can be covered on exchange. Given the content of the course material, required courses such as COMM 393 Commercial Law and COMM 394 Environment, Society, and Government must be taken at UBC.
+
 Can I afford to go on exchange?
+
 Going on exchange is not as expensive as you might think. As an exchange student, you remain registered at UBC, which means you are eligible for scholarships, awards, bursaries, and student loans. You pay tuition directly to UBC and not the partner institution and may be eligible for an exchange-related scholarship. For example:
+
 Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration Award
+
 Awards valued between $3,500 - $7,000 are available to students in the Bachelor of Commerce program who are participating in an exchange program to the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration.
+
 For a list of other exchange awards available, including more partner-specific awards, see
+
 international learning awards on the UBC Go Global website
+
 .
+
 How does exchange affect my grades?
+
 While you receive credit for course work done abroad, you will not see grades earned on your UBC transcript. Your exchange grades therefore do not affect the average on your UBC transcript. Your exchange grades are however used internally to determine eligibility to continue in the BCom program, Dean's Honour Roll standing, scholarships, and degree standing at graduation. Your UBC transcripts indicates where you were on exchange, when you were on exchange, and how many transfer credits you earned. If applying to graduate school in the future you will be required to submit transcripts from all schools attended, including exchange schools.
+
 Grades obtained on exchange are not considered Credit/D/Fail unless your partner offers courses in that category. If this category (sometimes referred to as pass/fail) is available, the UBC rules regarding Credit/D/Fail apply. See Credit/D/Fail details
+
 here
+
 .
+
 Will going on exchange delay my graduation?
+
 As long as you plan accordingly and work closely with an advisor, going on exchange will not delay your graduation. However, if you are going on exchange in your final term of study in the BCom program in Term 2 of the winter session, you will not graduate in May, but will instead graduate in November.
+
 Where can I find more information?
+
 Visit
+
 UBC Go Global
+
 to research schools, find out about upcoming information sessions, and learn about all of the resources that can help make your exchange a rewarding experience.
+
 UBC Go Global
+
 The UBC Sauder School of Business exchange program is administered with the assistance of UBC Go Global, the central exchange office at UBC. Go Global is located in the UBC Life Building at 6138 Student Union Blvd.
+
 There you'll find a wide variety of printed materials such as university calendars and brochures from partner universities. See the
+
 UBC Global website
+
 for a list of events and information sessions, anticipated costs, a course database, FAQs, and much more.

 Day in the Life of a Singapore Exchange Student
+
 What's it like to study abroad? UBC Sauder student Jensen Tung shares his experience studying at the National University of Singapore.
+
 Registration
+
 If you're studying abroad, do not register in any UBC courses during your exchange term(s); only register in courses for the term that you will be attending UBC. Go Global will register you in an exchange code to indicate that you are on exchange, which will trigger your tuition for the term and enable awards staff to review your eligibility for the Go Global International Learning Award. If you do register in any courses in the term(s) that you are scheduled to be on exchange, you will be dropped from these courses. If for any reason you do not go on exchange, the UGO will assist you to register in any required COMM/COHR courses.

 Frequently asked questions about coming to the UBC Sauder on exchange
+
 How do I apply for exchange at UBC?
+
 The UBC Sauder School of Business exchange program is administered through UBC’s exchange program, Go Global. The
+
 UBC Go Global website
+
 has all the information you need about coming to UBC.
+
 Do I have the appropriate academic background to apply to the business school?
+
 To apply, you need to be at the academic level required for third and fourth year BCom courses. In general, you should have taken most of the following courses: micro and macro economics, calculus, statistics, managerial accounting, managerial economics, managerial finance, organizational behaviour, introduction to finance, and introduction to marketing.
+
 Where can I find the course schedule?
+
 Check the
+
 Student Service Centre Vancouver campus course schedule
+
 to find out if the courses you want to take are offered in the semester you plan to come. Term 1 means the fall semester, Term 2 means the spring semester, and business courses are labeled COMM and COHR.
+
 What courses can I take?
+
 Exchange students can take business courses along with a wide variety of other courses at UBC. Be sure to check the prerequisites required for each as it is important that you have the appropriate academic background to be successful. If you don't have required prerequisites and still want to take the course, you will need to seek the instructor’s permission at the first class. Note that Economics courses at UBC are offered through the Faculty of Arts and space in courses may be limited.
+
 Are there any business courses I can’t take?
+
 COMM 101, COMM 105, COMM 196, COMM 202, COMM 220, COMM 271, COMM 311, COMM 320, COMM 321, COMM 420, COMM 421, COMM 466, COMM 483, COMM 489, graduate (500 and 600-level) courses, COEC, and BUSI courses are not available. Space in second year business courses and other courses may be limited. Taking COMM 390/396 and COMM 395 requires permission from the instructor.
+
 Are course outlines online?
+
 You can check the
+
 UBC Calendar
+
 for brief course descriptions, including prerequisites required. More comprehensive
+
 Commerce course descriptions
+
 are available on our website.
+
 How many courses can I take?
+
 Students usually take 12 to 15 credits in a semester which typically means four or five courses. If you are taking 15 credits, it’s recommended that you take a maximum of 12 credits of business courses. Taking more is considered a heavy course load, and by combining business courses with electives you will have a more balanced workload and be able to explore other disciplines at UBC. If you are on exchange with UBC Sauder through a university that doesn’t have a business school partnership, you may be limited to six business course credits. You can take more as long as there is space available.
+
 Can I take courses if I’m not on exchange with the business school?
+
 If there is space available and you have the prerequisites, you can request to take business courses. COMR 100, COMR 329, COMR 398, COMR 458, COMR 465, COMR 473, and COMR 493 are typically taken by non-business majors.

 Rebuilding of Indigenous Economies
+
 A message from Dennis Thomas-Whonoak, our Executive Director of Indigenous Business
+
 Initiatives & Engagements:
+
 UBC Sauder of School of Business is committed to the rebuilding of Indigenous economies in alignment with the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). We recognize that achieving reconciliation will not be possible without vibrant Indigenous economies.
+
 To take meaningful reconciliatory action, UBC Sauder faculty and staff commit to ongoing cultural awareness training and learning of Indigenous pedagogy models. The two-eyed seeing approach will be a key factor in building bridges and fostering better relationships that support Indigenous students and communities. Guided by and rooted in the UBC Indigenous Strategic Plan, upholding safe student spaces and experiences is a top priority.
+
 Indigenous-led economic strategy is critical to the growth of Indigenous communities in Canada. Developing transformational business pathways ensure creative opportunities that will build a future generation of leaders. Interweaving traditional Indigenous pedagogy models with western theories will provide new platforms that allow positive growth in Indigenous communities. The unique advantage of Indigenous visionaries and entrepreneurs is the connection to cultural identity and their values system. Through these teachings they will rise to rebuild their Indigenous economies and be part of the economic fabric of Canada.
+

 Attendance
+
 Attendance
+
 Your instructors will cover a significant amount of content each week— absences from class may affect your participation grade and your understanding of the material covered in class.
+
 If you are unable to attend any lectures, tutorials, or any other course-related activities due to excused or unexcused absences, you must review the course syllabus or contact your instructor to inquire about an extended deadline. You must complete any missed coursework and assignments by the new deadline.
+
 You should not delay your preparation and completion of missed components of the course while awaiting the resolution of your request for academic concessions. If your concession is denied, a grade will not be assigned for the course component. Please note that students who neglect academic work, fail to attend classes regularly, or neglect their responsibilities as a student may be excluded from the final examination and put themselves at risk of failing courses.
+
 Some instructors may have specific requirements or policies regarding missed or late coursework for their courses. This is often based on a threshold of classes missed, after which the student is considered unable to meet the learning outcomes of the course.
+
 Review the course syllabus and contact your instructor regarding the course expectations. There are also general expectations outlined in UBC’s attendance policy.
+
 UBC attendance policy
+
 Unexcused absences
+
 Avoid scheduling conflicts or making arrangements that may conflict with your academic commitments and responsibilities. Important to note that travel arrangements are not valid grounds for academic concessions.
+
 Statement of professionalism and code of conduct
+
 Late course registration
+
 Registration is your responsibility. This means that, when joining a class late, you are responsible for the learning of any material that has already been taught. Your instructor is not expected to re-teach the material you have missed.
+
 You must complete all previously assigned readings and coursework to fully prepare to contribute to class discussions and engage in group work. For this reason, some instructors discourage late registration in their courses if group work or assignments are required during the first two weeks.
+
 Anticipated absences
+
 If your ability to attend classes or complete coursework and assignments is severely affected or if you expect regular or prolonged absences, you should contact an Academic Advisor in the UGO to further discuss your case.
+
 Students with a disability or ongoing medical condition
+
 Students registered with the
+
 Centre for Accessibility (CFA
+
 ) should have their accommodation agreed upon at the beginning of the course between the student, CFA, and the instructor. Students who are not registered with CFA may wish to discuss their case with the centre or connect with an Academic Advisor in the UGO.
+
 If illness or disability related reasons interfere with your ability to attend classes or complete coursework and assignment, you should follow the indications provided by your instructor and submit a request for Academic Concession through the Undergraduate Office (UGO).
+
 Varsity athletes
+
 These students have a letter outlining their Varsity commitments sent to the instructor by UBC Athletics.
+
 Unanticipated absences
+
 If you face unexpected illness or unavoidable responsibilities that impact your ability to fulfil your academic responsibilities, you could be eligible for an academic concession.
+
 An academic concession acknowledges the circumstances a student faces that are outside of their control or expectation, and grants them eligibility for adjustments to help them complete their studies.
+
 Am I qualified for an academic concession?
+

 Although, these two types of exams or a mix of the two are popular with instructors, you could also encounter exams with questions that require answers in the following responses: true/false, fill in the blanks, quantitive or problem solving, or short answers. Exams can also be online, oral, open book, or take home. Instructors may also develop an exam in a format not listed above. In any case, try to give yourself enough time to study the materials and get a good night's sleep the day before so that you are prepared for any questions that may come your way.

 Procrastination
+
 It's easy to fall off track and get stuck in a pattern of procrastination. To avoid the stress and anxiety that follows, here are some strategies to help get you started and trick yourself into taking action! Below are some of the best practices you can try out:
+
 Pomodoro technique: do uninterrupted work for 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break, then repeat 3 times and take a longer 20 minute break
+
 5 minutes: You can do almost anything for 5 minutes. Start an assignment, start reading a chapter, review your lecture notes, etc. You’ll find that after 5 minutes, you either want to keep plugging away at it, you’re almost done whatever you set out to do, or you’re really not into it. But at least you took action for those 5 minutes.

 Sounds silly, but put your phone somewhere you can’t get to it: give it to your neighbour in residence, charge it across the room, or turn it off so it’s more challenging to check it. At least keep it out of arm’s reach.

 UBC Sauder BCom Statement of Professionalism
+
 At UBC Sauder, professional behaviour aligns with the school’s guiding values – rigour, respect and responsibility. These values help shape our behaviour both inside the classroom and in our community and inspire and guide students, staff and faculty.
+
 How are we professional at UBC Sauder?
+
 Rigour
+
 Respect
+
 Responsibility
+
 Rigour
+
 Strive for excellence and do the best work we are capable of doing
+
 Act with personal and academic integrity
+
 Listen to our peers and colleagues with an open mind, and challenge our own opinions when beliefs differ from our own
+
 Make evidence-based decisions
+
 Respect
+
 Learn about others and sincerely respect their ways of seeing the world
+
 Be attentive and conscious of our words and actions and care how they impact others
+
 Be inclusive of other people from different cultures, backgrounds, experiences, and feelings
+
 Take care of our physical space in which we work and learn
+
 Maintain the confidentiality and privacy of our colleagues when appropriate
+
 Responsibility
+
 Make decisions that are socially responsible by considering the impact of our activities on others and the community at large
+
 Take care of our physical and mental wellbeing
+
 Meet deadlines, show up for classes/meetings on-time, come prepared to contribute and follow through on any commitments
+
 Take ownership for our mistakes
+
 Along with these three guiding values, our community also embraces three personal values that describe the preferred ways that we interact in the UBC Sauder community: authenticity, humility and compassion. These personal values are important to the UBC Sauder culture, but are not specifically relevant to commitments about professional actions and communications.
+
 The UBC Sauder BCom Statement of Professionalism and BCom Student Code of Conduct supplement existing standards and policies, such as
+
 UBC’s Student Code of Conduct
+
 ,
+
 UBC’s Academic Honesty and Standards
+
 ,
+
 UBC’s Respectful Environmental Statement
+
 , the
+
 BC Human Rights Code
+
 ,
+
 Student Declaration and Responsibility
+
 and the employment contracts and collective agreements that govern faculty and staff.
+
 UBC Sauder BCom Student Code of Conduct: Expectations and Implications
+
 Professionalism is demonstrated through actions that align with UBC Sauder’s core values – rigour, respect and responsibility. Students, like faculty, staff and alumni, are representatives of UBC Sauder and are committed to upholding these values and behaving professionally. This document outlines the expectations of our community and the consequences of unprofessional behaviour. Be sure to understand the specific expectations of all classes and activities at UBC Sauder. Ask questions if you don’t understand or need more information.
+
 Personal Well Being
+
 Above all else, taking care of your physical and mental health is a priority. A lack of sleep, nutrition, exercise or relaxation can reduce overall wellbeing and general performance, making the behaviours outlined below difficult. Although we, as members of the UBC community, have pledged to help and support each other, taking care of your own health and wellness is a core personal responsibility, in the same way it is your individual responsibility to complete coursework and be aware of deadlines. If you need support with maintaining your physical and mental health, there are resources provided
+
 within UBC Sauder
+
 and
+
 the greater UBC community
+
 to help you. Faculty, staff and your fellow students are also sources of support when you need help.
+
 Rigorous, Respectful and Responsible Behaviours
+
 Behaving in alignment with the school’s core values means being attentive and conscious of the impact of words or actions on others and our community at large. These behaviours include listening to people with an open mind, treating everyone at UBC Sauder equally and respecting the diversity of our community. The UBC Sauder BCom Statement of Professionalism sets out more examples of rigorous, respectful and responsible behaviours. Failure to do so damages the UBC Sauder culture, community, relationships and your personal integrity. It is critical that students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives be valued in and well-served by their courses. Furthermore, the diversity that students bring to the classroom should be viewed as a resource, benefit, and source of strength for your learning experience.
+
 Students who act disrespectfully toward others will be asked to leave the class or activity. Possible consequences range from being marked as absent for the day or being removed from a team to being withdrawn from the course.
+
 Academic Integrity
+
 Academic integrity means you conduct your work and studies honestly and in accordance with the UBC’s standards as outlined
+
 here
+
 . It is a fundamental first step in establishing your reputation as a professional and it is your obligation to inform yourself of these expectations.
+
 Not only are plagiarism and cheating detrimental to your education, but they undermine the goals of the university and are penalized. Examples include sharing your past assignments and answers with other students, submitting work that is not your own, working with other students on your coursework when the instructor has not permitted this, spreading information to other students through word of mouth, social media, or other channels that prevents the fair evaluation of a class exercise, assessment or activity, or misusing the intellectual property of others by distributing course materials to third-party websites or recording lectures without consent.
+
 Violations of academic integrity are taken seriously by UBC. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating typically result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences. Individual instructors and other professionals can take legal action for violations of their copyright.
+
 How can we maintain academic integrity?
+
 Read and abide by the rules, regulations, and expectations set out in the
+
 UBC Calendar
+
 . For example,
+
 Student Conduct during Examinations
+
 .
+
 Ensuring we are honest in doing our own assignments and prioritizing a strong work ethic
+
 Only sharing information about a course that does not undermine the instructor’s ability to accurately assess another student’s individual work
+
 Respecting the intellectual property of our peers, instructors, advisors and other community members, and media sources of all kinds
+
 Supporting the learning processes of our peers through tutoring and mentorship
+
 Citing work in the correct format, as outlined by our instructors or supervisors
+
 Attendance and Participation
+
 Students are expected to attend class and class-related events and activities regularly and on-time, as stated in the
+
 UBC Calendar Statement on Attendance
+
 . Job and co-op interviews, extra-curriculars and other appointments and commitments should all be scheduled outside of class hours.  Students who miss more than 20% of a course could be excluded from final examinations, removed from the class with a “withdrawal” or “fail” standing or given a mark of zero for participation. See individual course syllabi for specific class policies on attendance.
+
 If you have any difficulties with attendance, please discuss this with your instructor, supervisor, or the Undergraduate Office (UGO) as soon as possible. If you are unavoidably absent because of conflicting responsibilities, medical circumstances or compassionate grounds and you will be missing an exam or required coursework, you can apply for an academic concession. To manage this situation professionally, notify your instructor directly, and submit a request for academic concession to the UGO within 48 hours through the
+
 MyBCom website
+
 .
+
 When you are professional, you show up ready to engage and contribute. Depending on class size and format, students are expected to volunteer opinions and/or answers that reflect critical thought and thorough preparation, offer helpful feedback to their peers where appropriate, and contribute equitably to group assignments.
+
 Students are expected to be empathetic and respectful of their colleagues at all times, including faculty, staff and peers. This means being attentive and conscious of words and actions and their impact on others, listening to people with an open mind, treating all UBC Sauder community members equally and understanding diversity.
+
 Students who act disrespectfully toward others will be asked to leave the class and be marked as absent for the day. They may also be removed from a team, lose credit for in-class assessments and activities, or be asked to complete a group assignment individually.
+
 Use of Electronics
+
 In-person Classes
+
 The use of electronics in the classroom can be unprofessional, since it can be distracting to yourself, your peers and the instructor. For this reason, the default policy for the use of electronics in the classroom is “lids down”. This means that the norm for most classes is to avoid the use of electronic devices while class is in session.
+
 Different classes and activities require different electronic tools and any specific guidelines around in-class or meeting use of electronics are decided by each instructor or supervisor. It is our individual responsibility to understand and abide by these expectations and to behave appropriately. If laptops, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices are allowed or encouraged in the classroom, meeting or activity, they must be used strictly for the educational or professional purpose at hand. Using it for other personal or non-meeting related matters is unprofessional. It can also serve as a distraction to yourself and others around you.
+
 Students who use electronics that do not respect this norm may be asked to leave the class and may be penalized.
+
 Online Classes
+
 The use of electronics is essential in online learning, and UBC uses many learning technologies to support online courses.  Please refer to
+
 keeplearning.ubc.ca
+
 for best practices on how to effectively use these tools.
+
 Even if you are not sharing a physical space, students must still be respectful and mindful of their peers and instructors. Try to join your classes early – up to five minutes before start time to ensure you have everything working. Please have your video on unless you are experiencing connection issues.
+
 Put your microphone on mute when not speaking and use the “raise hand” feature if you would like to participate. Try to avoid talking over or at the same time as other participants. Just like in a regular classroom, it is important that you refrain from use of all other technology (phones, other applications, etc.) during classes.
+
 Physical Space
+
 Taking care of our physical space is a component of professionalism. When we respect our shared space, we take initiative to keep it in a condition where it is ready to be used by the next person. Things we can do to respect our shared space includes throwing out our trash, replacing rearranged furniture and respecting room-use policies.

 Academic concession
+
 Academic Concession
+
 At UBC, we care about your wellbeing and are committed to supporting you in your academic pursuits. We recognize that sometimes unanticipated events or circumstances can affect your ability to complete your academic responsibilities.
+
 What is Academic concession?
+
 An academic concession acknowledges the circumstances a student faces that are outside of their control or expectation and grants them eligibility for adjustments to help them complete their studies.
+
 These adjustments often consist of a later deadline for an assignment, an opportunity to complete a make-up test or quiz, a late withdraw (with a W standing), or a Deferred Standing (known as SD) for coursework and exams. Students should anticipate being asked to submit their assignment/coursework within reasonable time of their circumstances being resolved.
+
 UBC’s Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office (
+
 SVPRO
+
 ) can assist students with a request for academic concessions if the situation is related to an experience of sexual assault.
+
 Note: An academic concession is
+
 not
+
 the same as an academic accommodation. If you are already registered with the Centre for Accessibility (
+
 CFA
+
 ) and your disability or ongoing medical condition informs the grounds for academic concession, you may submit your request for academic concessions to the Undergraduate Office (
+
 UGO
+
 ) or CFA.
+
 If you missed in-term coursework: In-term academic concession
+
 In-term concessions for missed assignments, quizzes, mid-term, etc. typically take the form of an extended deadline, reweighting of missed marks to a later test or assignment, an alternate exam, or a different type of assessment.
+
 Note: Instructors determine the specifics of an in-term concession. The UGO is not involved in the decision-making for the specifics of an in-term concessions. If a request for concession is approved, it is your responsibility to contact your instructor and make any necessary arrangements as soon as possible. Refer to the course syllabus for additional instructions.
+
 If you missed final exams or end-of-term assignments: Standing Deferred
+
 If an academic concession is approved for a final exam, the student will receive a Deferred Standing (known as SD) for that course. You will be required to complete your final exam at a later date, most likely during the SD exam period (late July to early August for winter session courses, or mid-November for summer session courses) or you may agree to make alternate arrangements with the course instructors to write your missed exam at a different time before the SD deadline.
+
 Be aware that a Deferred Standing in a course(s) may also impact:
+
 Your academic standing evaluation and registration/graduation
+
 We may not be able to determine your eligibility to continue in our program or to be promoted to the next year level until you have completed all coursework, and a final grade(s) has been posted.
+
 Where possible, we will use interim grades (grades achieved to-date in courses with an SD, assuming zeroes for uncompleted coursework) to calculate your average. If you do not meet continuation/promotion requirements based on interim grades, your overall sessional average will be reassessed once your final grade(s) has been posted on your record; this may delay your registration and promotion for the next Winter Session or your eligibility to graduate.
+
 Your eligibility for UBC resources
+
 These may include UBC Housing, athletics, visa/study permits, funding (e.g., student loans, awards, scholarships), medical insurance, and other resources with minimum credit requirements.
+
 We strongly recommend that you reach out to the UBC Department that oversees the
+
 supports and resources
+
 that have credit requirements. If you don’t know who to contact, reach out to the UGO for assistance in navigating UBC.
+
 Other considerations:
+
 While it may be possible to write an SD exam off-campus, it requires you to make your own invigilation arrangements with a UBC approved invigilator that would be expected to follow UBC Invigilation Guidelines and Procedures. This may result and additional costs or travel to the writing location.
+
 SD exam may be scheduled several months after the course ends. This may result in having a heavier course load in a future term as you will have to prepare to write your SD exam while registered in other courses.
+
 Course material may not be available after the course ends. This may include copyright material, content removed from the Canvas shell, etc. Students are responsible for the course content and materials needed to prepare for an exam.
+
 Before you apply
+
 There are several steps you need to take before you apply for academic concession. The UGO receives many concession requests throughout the school year; therefore, these steps are crucial in ensuring a more efficient process. Please follow the steps below to ensure we can process your request as quickly as possible:
+
 1. Review UBC’s Academic Concession Policy
+
 UBC Academic Concession Policy
+
 2. Check if you are eligible for academic concessions
+
 You may be eligible for an academic concession if:
+
 You missed an evaluated component in a course,
+
 You have been attending classes regularly,
+
 You have been regularly completing coursework,
+
 Your request covers a short period of time,
+
 You are able to meet the learning outcomes of the course.
+
 Please note that once an exam has started, the grade earned will stand and there will be no additional opportunity to increase the mark.
+
 Your academic concession request is based on grounds supported by the UBC Academic Concessions policy:
+
 Conflicting responsibilities
+
 This may include family care, paid employment in some circumstances, religious practices, or military duty that conflict with academic requirements and are beyond your control.
+
 Medical circumstances
+
 This can cover a mental or physical health issue that emerges or recurs during a term.
+
 Compassionate grounds
+
 A concession may be granted when a student experiences a traumatic event, sexual assault, or death in the family or of a close friend.
+
 Conflicting travel plans or feeling unprepared will not merit academic concession. Use your own judgment to determine if your circumstances match any of these cases before you apply for academic concession.
+
 If you're submitting a concession request, be prepared to show supporting documentation and/or have a discussion with an academic advisor. Be aware that falsifying information for an academic concession is considered academic misconduct.
+
 3. Refer to your course syllabus
+
 Every course is different, and each will have its specific instructions or information on requesting concession for the specific course.
+
 Your course syllabus will outline which circumstances will require you to submit a request for academic concession and how concession will be applied if your request is approved.
+
 4. Inform your instructor
+
 Follow the instructions in your course outline and let your instructor know as soon as possible about any missed lectures or coursework and confirm your understanding of what a concession may entail and how the work will be completed.
+
 Deadlines
+
 You are expected to submit a request for academic concessions within 48 hours of the missed coursework, exam, or deadline.
+
 Winter Session, Term 1 -- January 31
+
 Winter Session, Term 2 -- May 31
+
 Summer Session (both terms) – September 30
+
 The deadlines for completing all SD course work as per UBC Calendar are:
+

 Applying for an academic concession
+
 After completing the previous steps, apply via the link below:
+
 Apply for in-term concession
+
 Apply for Deferred Standing
+
 Providing documentation to support
+
 While a self-declaration may suffice for a first incidence, for some circumstances, you may be required to submit supporting documentation along with, or following, your self-declaration.
+
 We trust that the information you provide is accurate and truthful. The submission of false information to obtain academic concession is classified as academic misconduct and will be subject to investigation and the appropriate discipline action.
+
 We also understand documentation is not always possible. Self-declaration of your circumstances may be sufficient for:
+
 the first occurrence of an acute illness
+
 a request on compassionate grounds
+
 a conflicting responsibility for which there is no practicable way to provide a letter or other official document from an organization
+
 Next steps after approval
+
 Next steps for in-term concessions
+
 If your concession request for an in-term exam or coursework is approved, you should continue to work on the coursework or prepare for the exam, for which you have submitted the concession as soon as you are able to do so.
+
 Next steps for Deferred Standing
+
 If your concession request for a final exam or final term coursework is approved, you will be granted a Deferred Standing (or Standing Deferred) and a notation of ‘SD’ will be added to the course on your academic record. Your course grade will remain incomplete until you have completed all coursework.
+
 If your academic concession is approved and an “SD” has been added to your student record:
+
 Review any information provided by the UGO and your course instructor (e.g., email, course outline, Canvas)
+
 Monitor your email and follow the instructions provided. Review
+
 course exceptions
+
 for alternate exam dates that differ from the official deferred exam period.
+
 Apply through the SSC to write your exam(s) in the application period outlined by Enrolment Services.
+
 Write your deferred exam as scheduled by Enrolment Services unless otherwise indicated by your instructor and submit incomplete coursework as per your instructor’s directions.
+
 Deferred exams for Winter Session courses are held the following July/August.
+
 Deferred exams for Summer Session courses are held in November.
+
 What happens after I’ve written my deferred exam?
+
 After you’ve written your exam, your instructor will calculate and submit your final course grade. The SD notation will be removed when your final grade is posted.
+
 Please note that once an exam has started, the grade earned will stand and there will be no additional opportunity to increase the mark.
+
 What happens if I miss my deferred exam?
+
 If you are unable to complete a deferred course due to extenuating circumstances, you may request additional academic concessions in the form of a late withdrawal (with a W standing). Your request for concession must be accompanied by supporting documentation.
+
 More information on standing deferred deadlines can be found on
+
 Enrolment Services.
+
 What options may be available if I am not eligible for a Deferred Standing?
+
 When academic concessions cannot be processed in the form of an SD (due to the nature of the missed work or the duration of the academic concession), an Academic Advisor may explore the possibility of granting a late withdrawal (with a W standing) from the course.
+
 If your request for academic concessions is denied
+
 A request for academic concessions may be denied on the following grounds:
+
 You have made repeated requests for academic concessions
+
 You have already completed the coursework or wrote the exam
+
 There is an investigation of academic misconduct in progress
+
 You did not submit a request for academic concessions on a timely manner (within 48-hours) and were not prevented by extenuating circumstances from doing so
+
 You were required to provide additional information/documentation to support your request and you failed to follow up accordingly.
+
 Making up missed coursework is not feasible. An Academic Advisor or Accessibility Advisor may reach out to discuss alternatives that may be available for your case.
+
 You have missed too many classes, as per the requirements set out in the course syllabus.
+
 Statement of Professionalism and Code of Conduct
+
 UBC Attendance Policy
+
 If your request for academic concessions is denied, an Academic Advisor in the Undergraduate Office will inform you.

 The UBC Calendar
+
 The
+
 UBC Calendar
+
 is our official rulebook. Refer to it for comprehensive information about all of the programs, courses, services, and academic policies of the University. Much of the information is also presented here on the myBCom website. We’ve made every effort to ensure its completeness and accuracy; however, in any instance where this website does not agree with the information in the UBC Calendar, the regulations and policies in the Calendar will prevail. The UBC Sauder School of Business and the University reserve the right to change academic policies at their discretion. Such changes may be implemented without prior notice and may be applied to currently enrolled students.
+
 Consult the UBC Calendar for:
+
 academic policies and regulations
+
 dates and deadlines for the academic year
+
 degree requirements
+
 Knowing about the policies and regulations that apply to you as a UBC student will help you to better plan your studies and make smart decisions toward achieving academic success.
+
 It's up to you to:
+
 take responsibility for your goals, values, and academic decision making.
+
 Reach out to an academic advisor or career coach
+
 if you need help or guidance.
+
 consult Chapman Learning Commons resource guides
+
 to learn what constitutes plagiarism, how to properly cite your work, and what it means to respect copyright.
+
 attend classes and exams.
+
 If you are absent due to circumstances beyond your control, inform us as soon as possible. You may be eligible for an
+
 academic concession
+
 .
+
 know when the UBC exam periods
+
 are and don’t make travel plans until you have confirmed your exam schedule.
+
 Academic concession
+
 If you are experiencing unanticipated events or circumstances that are affecting your ability to complete your academic responsibilities you may be eligible for academic concession.
+

+
 Communications

 As a UBC student you’ll sometimes feel inundated with information. The University’s central and program offices, instructors, and student organizations all have a need to communicate important information to students about programs, campus life, resources and enrichment opportunities. Monitor your email regularly and follow campus social media channels to stay informed.
+

 Communication Development Programs
+
 Sign-up and reservation information for all 3 Professional Communication workshops will be posted on Canvas through the CLC: Online Calendar. Although reserving a spot isn't a requirement to attend the Professional Communication Workshops, it helps the coach prepare for the session. You can do this by spot by selecting 'CLC: Online' and finding appointments on the Canvas Calendar. If you would like to attend a Writing Coaching session, please do make a reservation as this is a 1-on-1 service.
+
 Writing Support
+
 CLC Writing Coaching
+
 One-on-one writing appointments with our professional Writing Coach can help with planning, idea development, tone, stylistic improvement, and error recognition. Any genre of writing is suitable; however, this is not an editing service and attendees are expected to participate actively in the conversation.
+
 Attendees must bring a printed copy of their work to review during their appointment. Possible writing samples include a draft of an academic assignment, a cover letter, a professional email, etc.
+
 To register for an appointment, visit your Canvas Calendar, click “Find Appointments,” select “CLC: Online,” and hit submit. Click on each appointment to learn more and register.
+

 Professional Communication Workshops

 Professional Communication Workshops are a series of 3 distinct programs offered by the CLC and are led by Professional Communication Coaches, who are experienced student leaders within Sauder. More detailed information about workshop times and registration can be found through the Communications Programming page in the CLC: Online Canvas course.
+
 This program consists of the following workshops:
+
 Speaking on the Spot:
+
 Speaking on the Spot workshops are the perfect opportunity for students to build on their public speaking and impromptu speaking skills. Students learn and practice, while also receiving insightful feedback from peers in an encouraging and safe environment. These free weekly workshops, which  focus on a new topic every week, progressively challenge students throughout the term to develop their comfort level and skill set by providing opportunities to practice and engage with others.
+
 English Conversation Circles:
+
 English Conversation Circles are casual and friendly weekly discussion sessions that allow students to practice conversational English skills and connect with peers outside of a formal or academic setting. The sessions are designed to focus on everyday topics that support English Language Learners as well as newcomers to Vancouver and Canada. English Conversation Circles are free to attend.
+
 Weekly Session Topics Include:
+
 Things to do in Vancouver and within British Columbia
+
 Activities at UBC
+
 Food, restaurants and holidays
+
 Canadian customs
+
 Games and sports
+
 Getting to know new people
+
 Preparing for Canadian weather
+
 Much more!
+
 Professional Communication Skills Certificate:
+
 The Professional Communication Skills Certificate program is a series of 10 workshops where students will learn and practice comprehensive professional communication etiquette. Session topics are developed to complement the current needs and trends in professional settings. Students will receive a certificate of completion after attending all 10 sessions. More information about session topics and how to complete this program can be found in the Professional Communication Skills Certificate section in 'CLC: Online'.

These highly interactive sessions are led by upper-year students, supporting collaborative learning strategies to help students process and review course content, while also developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. PASS sessions are open to all students who are enrolled in PASS-affiliated courses and provide opportunities for attendees to meet and work with other students in the course!
+
 PASS is offered by the Canaccord Learning Commons (CLC).
+
 Every term, sessions begin approximately the 3rd week of class.
+
 More information about which courses are offered by PASS and delivery methods can be found in the 'CLC: Online' canvas course, and in course-specific canvas sites for affiliated courses.

 UBC Sauder Learning Labs
+
 UBC Sauder Learning Labs
+
 What are the UBC Sauder Learning Labs?
+
 The UBC Sauder Learning Labs are designed to foster strategic design, an emerging business discipline where multi-disciplinary project teams use creative and critical thinking, and data analysis to create, test, and launch solutions to ‘big picture” problems.
+
 The learning labs are not typical classrooms. The instructor does not stand behind a lectern at the front of the class, but instead circulates freely throughout the space. Teams of students cluster at tables throughout the room for brainstorming and lively discussion. Wall-to-wall back-lit whiteboards serve as large canvases for ideas and mind maps. At each table, a video camera and large LCD screen allow students to view media and communicate with other teams in the room or collaborators from anywhere in the world.
+
 The learning labs are home to one of the school’s most unique courses,
+
 COMM 388 Design Methods for Business Innovation
+
 . In this project-driven course, students from Commerce, Arts, Engineering and Environmental Design employ analytical and creative thinking techniques to both ask questions and find solutions to real world business challenges. They also learn about sustainable business practices and effective teams.
