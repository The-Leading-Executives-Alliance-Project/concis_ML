In addition, students in third year must select an option and complete the specific option program requirements set out below. Students who were initially registered in the B.Com. program prior to September 1, 2022, should consult the Undergraduate Office regarding the requirements to complete the program. Students completing the B.Com. with a Combined Major in Business and Computer Science should refer to the degree requirements listed under the Business and Computer Science-Combined Major option. A student transferring from another university or college may be granted transfer credit for a maximum of 50% of degree requirements. All upper-level commerce core courses and option core courses must be completed while registered in the Bachelor of Commerce program. Bachelor of Commerce First Year ECON 101/102 6 COMM 101 1 3 COMM 105 3 COMM 190 3 COMM 191 2 3 COMM 192 2 3 COMM 196 3 MATH 100 3 3 Non-Commerce electives 4 3 Total Credits 30 Second Year COMM 202 1 COMM 293, 294, 298 9 COMM 295 5 3 COMM 203, 204, 205, and 296 12 Non-Commerce electives 4 6 Total Credits 31 Third Year COMM 393 3 COMM 394 3 COMM 396 3 Options Requirements (as specified below) 6 Electives 4 15 Total Credits 30 Fourth Year COMM 491 3 COMM 400 1 Option requirements (as specified below) 9 Electives 4 18 Total Credits 31 1 COMM 101 is not required for students transferring to Second or Third Year of the program. Transfer students must complete 3 credits of Commerce or Non-Commerce courses at any level in lieu of COMM 101. 2 For students transferring into Second or Third Year of the program, the following are acceptable alternatives: COMM 191: STAT 200 (if taken at UBC prior to admission to the program) COMM 192: COMM 329 or COMR 329. 3 Acceptable alternatives are MATH 180 or 110. Students planning to specialize in Economics or Computer Science must take MATH 100 and 101 (or equivalents). Students should make themselves aware of elective courses for which MATH 100 and 101 are prerequisites and plan accordingly. 4 At least 27 credits of the 42 credits of electives in the Bachelor of Commerce program must be non-Commerce with at least 12 credits at the senior level. Additional electives in third and fourth years may be either Commerce or Non-Commerce courses. The non-Commerce electives must include at least 3 credits in the humanities, and at least 3 credits in science or social science. Language courses are not eligible for the humanities requirement, but literature courses are. Visit the Faculty for list of eligible departments and/or courses.

Enrolment in required option courses may be limited. Students may select their option in the summer registration period prior to third year, but must make their choice no later than the end of Term 1 of Winter Session of the third year in the program. While it may be possible to change options at the end of Term 1, there may not be sufficient space in all of the required courses. Because registration access is based on GPA, students with lower marks will register later and may be unable to gain admission to the option of their first choice. For this reason students are encouraged to plan for a second and third choice. Changes to options made at the end of Term 1 require the approval of the Undergraduate Office. Each option program assumes that there is a normal sequence of courses, as listed by the Faculty . Students are expected to recognize these normal sequences in planning their program. Any exceptions must be approved by the director or associate director of the undergraduate program. Students may be required to undertake field work in the business community. A charge may be made for material supplied by the Faculty for use in classes. Courses in Commerce generally are reserved for students registered in a degree program in Commerce. However, there are exceptions to this regulation. Special arrangements have been made for students registered in other faculties in programs, as approved by Senate, which specifically require Commerce courses. Non-Commerce students should consult their faculty to see if such arrangements have been made for their program of study. Students who have obtained a First Class average (80% or higher) in their third year may elect to register for up to 6 credits of 500-level courses chosen in consultation with the chair of the division, the instructor, and the director or associate director of the undergraduate program. Dean's Honour Roll The words "Dean's Honour Roll" will be placed on a student's transcript if they have achieved an average of 80% or better in a Winter Session. To be eligible, a Winter Session must contain at least 24 percentage-graded credits. Students in a co-operative education program who are registered at UBC for only one term in Winter Session because of a co-op placement must be in a program of 12 credits for that term. Grades obtained by students registered in a study abroad or exchange program during the Winter Session will be considered. To qualify, a student must pass all courses. Degree Completion Students must complete their degree requirements within six years of their original admission into the Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration. Degree with Honours The words "with Honours" will be placed on the transcript of record and the degree certificate of a student graduating with the Bachelor of Commerce where the average is 80% or better in all upper-level Commerce courses. Grades obtained by students registered in a study abroad and exchange program will be considered. As well, the student must be enrolled in a 24 percentage-graded credit course load in Winter Session in at least one of year 3 or year 4. Program Approval Students are responsible for the completeness and accuracy of registration as it relates to the regulations of the program in which they are enrolled. Any variation from a full load must be approved by an academic advisor in the Undergraduate Office. Unsatisfactory Performance Students whose performance in the Faculty is unsatisfactory will be required to discontinue study in the Faculty for at least one year. Students who have failed to meet the continuation requirements of the University will be considered to have failed the year and will be required to discontinue study in the University for at least one year. Continuation requirements are listed in the table Summary of Continuation Requirements below and are subject to the following: Student performance is considered unsatisfactory when the average taken in any year, including failed courses, is below 60%. Students who fail the year or are required to discontinue study in the Faculty may apply for readmission only after 12 months. Students at any level of university study who are required for a second time to discontinue studies in the Faculty, whether in repeating a year or in a later year, will be required to withdraw from the University. Readmission to Commerce in such cases is normally not granted. Any students whose academic records, as determined by the tests and examinations of Term 1, are found to be unsatisfactory may be required to discontinue attendance in Commerce for the remainder of the session.

+Bachelor of Commerce
+Academic Regulations
+Academic Regulations
+The following regulations regarding Commerce courses apply:
+Students are admitted to the B.Com. program, not to particular fields of concentration (options). Enrolment in required option courses may be limited. Students may select their option in the summer registration period prior to third year, but must make their choice no later than the end of Term 1 of Winter Session of the third year in the program. While it may be possible to change options at the end of Term 1, there may not be sufficient space in all of the required courses. Because registration access is based on GPA, students with lower marks will register later and may be unable to gain admission to the option of their first choice. For this reason students are encouraged to plan for a second and third choice. Changes to options made at the end of Term 1 require the approval of the Undergraduate Office.
+Each option program assumes that there is a normal sequence of courses, as listed by the
+Faculty
+. Students are expected to recognize these normal sequences in planning their program. Any exceptions must be approved by the director or associate director of the undergraduate program.
+Students may be required to undertake field work in the business community.
+A charge may be made for material supplied by the Faculty for use in classes.
+Courses in Commerce generally are reserved for students registered in a degree program in Commerce. However, there are exceptions to this regulation. Special arrangements have been made for students registered in other faculties in programs, as approved by Senate, which specifically require Commerce courses. Non-Commerce students should consult their faculty to see if such arrangements have been made for their program of study.
+Students who have obtained a First Class average (80% or higher) in their third year may elect to register for up to 6 credits of 500-level courses chosen in consultation with the chair of the division, the instructor, and the director or associate director of the undergraduate program.
+Dean's Honour Roll
+The words "Dean's Honour Roll" will be placed on a student's transcript if they have achieved an average of 80% or better in a Winter Session. To be eligible, a Winter Session must contain at least 24 percentage-graded credits. Students in a co-operative education program who are registered at UBC for only one term in Winter Session because of a co-op placement must be in a program of 12 credits for that term. Grades obtained by students registered in a study abroad or exchange program during the Winter Session will be considered. To qualify, a student must pass all courses.
+Degree Completion
+Students must complete their degree requirements within six years of their original admission into the Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration.
+Degree with Honours
+The words "with Honours" will be placed on the transcript of record and the degree certificate of a student graduating with the Bachelor of Commerce where the average is 80% or better in all upper-level Commerce courses. Grades obtained by students registered in a study abroad and exchange program will be considered. As well, the student must be enrolled in a 24 percentage-graded credit course load in Winter Session in at least one of year 3 or year 4.
+Program Approval
+Students are responsible for the completeness and accuracy of registration as it relates to the regulations of the program in which they are enrolled. Any variation from a full load must be approved by an academic advisor in the Undergraduate Office.
+Unsatisfactory Performance
+Students whose performance in the Faculty is unsatisfactory will be required to discontinue study in the Faculty for at least one year. Students who have failed to meet the continuation requirements of the University will be considered to have failed the year and will be required to discontinue study in the University for at least one year. Continuation requirements are listed in the table Summary of Continuation Requirements below and are subject to the following:
+Student performance is considered unsatisfactory when the average taken in any year, including failed courses, is below 60%.
+Students who fail the year or are required to discontinue study in the Faculty may apply for readmission only after 12 months.
+Students at any level of university study who are required for a second time to discontinue studies in the Faculty, whether in repeating a year or in a later year, will be required to withdraw from the University. Readmission to Commerce in such cases is normally not granted.
+Any students whose academic records, as determined by the tests and examinations of Term 1, are found to be unsatisfactory may be required to discontinue attendance in Commerce for the remainder of the session.

The Co-operative Education program is an optional, year-round program, supplementary to academic programs in the Faculty. A minimum of three work terms must be completed including at least one term in either Term 1 or Term 2 of the Winter Session. Students must end their degree on an academic term. Students wishing to enrol in the program must apply in September of either second or third year. Academic performance and workplace suitability (as judged by the Sauder Co-operative Education Office) will be the selection criteria used for program admission. Total enrolment is subject to the availability of appropriate work placements. Acceptance into the program does not guarantee work placements. Students admitted to the program must register in the appropriate co-operative education course for each work term, once a suitable work experience is confirmed. Payment of the Co-operative Education program fees is mandatory. This includes a Co-operative Education Program Fee for each work term and a one-time Co-operative Education Program Workshop Fee. See Program and Course Fees . Students have a site visit with their supervisor and a Sauder Co-op representative near the mid-point of each work term and submit an end-of-term assignment that are requirement s of the program. Each successfully completed co-operative education course is assigned 3 co-op credits on a student’s academic transcript (i.e. COMM 380, 381, 480 and 481). In order to graduate in a co-operative education program, a student must complete a minimum of 9 co-op credits in addition to the normal academic requirements to complete a Bachelor of Commerce degree. Participation in the Co-operative Education Program typically necessitates an additional two terms to complete the Bachelor of Commerce degree. Students transferring to UBC from accredited co-operative programs at other institutions may request admission to the Sauder Co-operative Education Program and, if accepted, may receive co-op credit for one previously completed work term. For more information, contact the Sauder Co-op Program.

+Co-operative Education
+Co-operative Education
+The
+Sauder Co-operative Education Program
+ is intended to provide interested and qualified students in the Faculty with paid work experience relevant to their future careers. The Co-operative Education program is an optional, year-round program, supplementary to academic programs in the Faculty. A minimum of three work terms must be completed including at least one term in either Term 1 or Term 2 of the Winter Session. Students must end their degree on an academic term.
+Students wishing to enrol in the program must apply in September of either second or third year. Academic performance and workplace suitability (as judged by the Sauder Co-operative Education Office) will be the selection criteria used for program admission. Total enrolment is subject to the availability of appropriate work placements. Acceptance into the program does not guarantee work placements. Students admitted to the program must register in the appropriate co-operative education course for each work term, once a suitable work experience is confirmed. Payment of the Co-operative Education program fees is mandatory. This includes a Co-operative Education Program Fee for each work term and a one-time Co-operative Education Program Workshop Fee. See
+Program and Course Fees
+.
+Students have a site visit with their supervisor and a Sauder Co-op representative
+near the mid-point of each work term
+ and
+submit an end-of-term assignment
+ that are
+requirement
+s
+ of the program.
+Each successfully completed co-operative education course is assigned 3 co-op credits on a student’s academic transcript (i.e. COMM 380, 381, 480 and 481). In order to graduate in a co-operative education program, a student must complete a minimum of 9 co-op credits in addition to the normal academic requirements to complete a Bachelor of Commerce degree. Participation in the Co-operative Education Program typically necessitates an additional two terms to complete the Bachelor of Commerce degree.
+Students transferring to UBC from accredited co-operative programs at other institutions may request admission to the Sauder Co-operative Education Program and, if accepted, may receive co-op credit for one previously completed work term.
+
+For more information, contact the Sauder Co-op Program.

+Bachelor of Commerce
+Introduction
+Introduction
+The Bachelor of Commerce is a four-year specialized program and is intended for students interested in one of eleven  specialized fields in business. The first two years are devoted to building a foundation in the related sciences and humanities and to learning the fundamentals of business issues, principles, and practices.
+The professional and specialized aspects of the curriculum are largely concentrated in the last two years. Because of the breadth and variety of topics covered, all students must take a specified "core" of courses and then arrange a series of carefully selected and integrated courses to complete an option. For necessary core courses, see
+Degree Requirements
+. Students may contact the Commerce Undergraduate Office for more details concerning each option in the program.
