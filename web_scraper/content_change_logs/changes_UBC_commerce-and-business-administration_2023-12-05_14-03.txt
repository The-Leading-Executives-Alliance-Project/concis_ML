 You should follow the academic concession request process as outlined by your home faculty advising office. Each faculty has its own process for in-term concessions and it is important for you to follow those guidelines in order for the request to be approved. The UGO will help you only if your home faculty advising office asks you to connect with your instructor regarding your request, and your instructor then asks you to contact the UGO. We anticipate that many COMM, COHR, COMR, COEC instructors will follow this process. If this is what you have been asked to do, then you can fill out the academic concession request form for BCom students. Please disregard the note that says the form is only for BCom students and submit the form for an in-term request. We will confirm with both you and the instructor that the information we receive is correct. Note that this process only applies to in-term requests.

 An exam hardship is when you have three final exams scheduled within a 24-hour period. If the third exam falls on the 25th hour, it is not considered a hardship. For example, if the first exam is on Monday at 8:30am, the second exam is at 3:30pm, and the third exam is on Tuesday at 8:30am, there is no official hardship because the third exam starts just after the 24-hour period expires.
 If you face an exam hardship, you will be given an alternative exam date for the second exam. Contact the instructor of your second exam no later than one month prior to the scheduled exam date for courses in the winter session and no later than two weeks prior to the scheduled exam date for courses in the summer session.

 The goal of the course is to provide students with knowledge and hands-on experience helping build high potential venture-scale start-ups based on a solid foundation of technology and/or science and engineering. Students will become familiar with the CDL-Vancouver companies and will have the opportunity to support them with market analysis, customer development, financial analysis, and other core activities related to building early stage start-ups. Students will also get some insight in how angel investors (and VCs) make investment decisions. Indeed, the work students do for ventures will be seen by the mentors/investors in the CDL program, and influence their investment decisions and the progress of the ventures. Some of the students across the CDL network have joined venture-backed CDL companies in key roles – this course is a unique opportunity for students who are interested in real world exposure to start-ups and seed funding.

 This course is a combination of both lecture and workshop sessions in which students will advance their CDL-Vancouver ventures. Workshops will draw upon knowledge from entrepreneurship and start-up best practices across many verticals and students will be coached by guest speakers such as venture capitalists, lawyers, project managers, and marketing professionals. Projects and assignments will be conducted for the benefit of the CDL ventures and students alike.

 During the course, teams of five or six students will propose one or more products, then evaluate the products based on their potential market, their estimated manufacturing and distribution costs, and other factors. The output from the course will be the development of a business plan for a proposed new enterprise, and the demonstration of a prototype of the product. Commerce students will primarily lead the business plan development, and students in engineering will primarily lead the prototype development. For example, the product can be a new physical device, a new software product, or a new engineering process. Lectures in the course will address creativity, market definition, financial projections, the design cycle, product marketing, manufacturing, distribution, support and repair.

Because of CSP, I was able to realize how drawn I am to research, and am now pursuing a Ph.D. in Business Administration"

 Thanks to the 2009 partnership between the UBC Sauder School of Business and the Faculty of Management, you can now expand the foundation of your degree as well as experience the intimacy of learning at a small campus. UBCO cross campus mobility allows students to spend a term of Year 4 of the BCom program studying at the UBCO Faculty of Management.
 Surrounded by orchards and vineyards, UBC’s state-of-the-art Okanagan campus is located in sunny Kelowna, BC. During the summer you can lounge on lakeside sandy beaches, or hike and mountain bike nearby trails. In the winter, the region’s legendary champagne powder makes for fantastic skiing and snowboarding.

 Possible second options
 Students cannot complete a second option in Finance or General Business Management. However, there is usually limited space in Accounting, Business Technology Management, Marketing, Organizational Behaviour and Human Resources, Real Estate, and Operations and Logistics.
 Limited course availability
 Because the majority of seats in each option course are allocated to students officially in that option, availability for non-option students is very limited. Students who wish to complete a second option can often only access available seats in these courses starting in Year 4. This means that you may need to stay for an extra term or year to complete all the courses required for your second option as many of the Year 4 option courses have Year 3 prerequisites.
 If you're planning to complete a second option, it's up to you to register yourself in any requirements for that option.
 You'll only be eligible to register in general seats for other options, if any are available.

 Do I have the appropriate academic background to apply to the business school?
 To apply, you need to be at the academic level required for third and fourth year BCom courses. In general, you should have taken most of the following courses: micro and macro economics, calculus, statistics, managerial accounting, managerial economics, managerial finance, organizational behaviour, introduction to finance, and introduction to marketing.

+to find out if the courses you want to take are offered in the semester you plan to come. Term 1 means the fall semester, Term 2 means the spring semester, and business courses are labeled COMM and COHR.
 What courses can I take?
 Exchange students can take business courses along with a wide variety of other courses at UBC. Be sure to check the prerequisites required for each as it is important that you have the appropriate academic background to be successful. If you don't have required prerequisites and still want to take the course, you will need to seek the instructor’s permission at the first class. Note that Economics courses at UBC are offered through the Faculty of Arts and space in courses may be limited.

+are available on our website.
 How many courses can I take?
 Students usually take 12 to 15 credits in a semester which typically means four or five courses. If you are taking 15 credits, it’s recommended that you take a maximum of 12 credits of business courses. Taking more is considered a heavy course load, and by combining business courses with electives you will have a more balanced workload and be able to explore other disciplines at UBC. If you are on exchange with UBC Sauder through a university that doesn’t have a business school partnership, you may be limited to six business course credits. You can take more as long as there is space available.
 Can I take courses if I’m not on exchange with the business school?
 If there is space available and you have the prerequisites, you can request to take business courses. COMR 100, COMR 329, COMR 398, COMR 458, COMR 465, COMR 473, and COMR 493 are typically taken by non-business majors.

 How does exchange affect my grades?
 While you receive credit for course work done abroad, you will not see grades earned on your UBC transcript. Your exchange grades therefore do not affect the average on your UBC transcript. Your exchange grades are however used internally to determine eligibility to continue in the BCom program, Dean's Honour Roll standing, scholarships, and degree standing at graduation. Your UBC transcripts indicates where you were on exchange, when you were on exchange, and how many transfer credits you earned. If applying to graduate school in the future you will be required to submit transcripts from all schools attended, including exchange schools.

+UBC Sauder BCom Student Code of Conduct: Expectations and Implications
 Professionalism is demonstrated through actions that align with UBC Sauder’s core values – rigour, respect and responsibility. Students, like faculty, staff and alumni, are representatives of UBC Sauder and are committed to upholding these values and behaving professionally. This document outlines the expectations of our community and the consequences of unprofessional behaviour. Be sure to understand the specific expectations of all classes and activities at UBC Sauder. Ask questions if you don’t understand or need more information.
 Personal Well Being
 Above all else, taking care of your physical and mental health is a priority. A lack of sleep, nutrition, exercise or relaxation can reduce overall wellbeing and general performance, making the behaviours outlined below difficult. Although we, as members of the UBC community, have pledged to help and support each other, taking care of your own health and wellness is a core personal responsibility, in the same way it is your individual responsibility to complete coursework and be aware of deadlines. If you need support with maintaining your physical and mental health, there are resources provided

+and
 the greater UBC community
- to help you. Faculty, staff and your fellow students are also sources of support when you need help.
+to help you. Faculty, staff and your fellow students are also sources of support when you need help.
 Rigorous, Respectful and Responsible Behaviours
 Behaving in alignment with the school’s core values means being attentive and conscious of the impact of words or actions on others and our community at large. These behaviours include listening to people with an open mind, treating everyone at UBC Sauder equally and respecting the diversity of our community. The UBC Sauder BCom Statement of Professionalism sets out more examples of rigorous, respectful and responsible behaviours. Failure to do so damages the UBC Sauder culture, community, relationships and your personal integrity. It is critical that students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives be valued in and well-served by their courses. Furthermore, the diversity that students bring to the classroom should be viewed as a resource, benefit, and source of strength for your learning experience.
 Students who act disrespectfully toward others will be asked to leave the class or activity. Possible consequences range from being marked as absent for the day or being removed from a team to being withdrawn from the course.

 Even if you are not sharing a physical space, students must still be respectful and mindful of their peers and instructors. Try to join your classes early – up to five minutes before start time to ensure you have everything working. Please have your video on unless you are experiencing connection issues.
 Put your microphone on mute when not speaking and use the “raise hand” feature if you would like to participate. Try to avoid talking over or at the same time as other participants. Just like in a regular classroom, it is important that you refrain from use of all other technology (phones, other applications, etc.) during classes.

The Co-operative Education program is an optional, year-round program, supplementary to academic programs in the Faculty. A minimum of three work terms must be completed including at least one term in either Term 1 or Term 2 of the Winter Session. Students must end their degree on an academic term.
 Students wishing to enrol in the program must apply in September of either second or third year. Academic performance and workplace suitability (as judged by the Sauder Co-operative Education Office) will be the selection criteria used for program admission. Total enrolment is subject to the availability of appropriate work placements. Acceptance into the program does not guarantee work placements. Students admitted to the program must register in the appropriate co-operative education course for each work term, once a suitable work experience is confirmed. Payment of the Co-operative Education program fees is mandatory. This includes a Co-operative Education Program Fee for each work term and a one-time Co-operative Education Program Workshop Fee. See
 Program and Course Fees

+of the program.
 Each successfully completed co-operative education course is assigned 3 co-op credits on a student’s academic transcript (i.e. COMM 380, 381, 480 and 481). In order to graduate in a co-operative education program, a student must complete a minimum of 9 co-op credits in addition to the normal academic requirements to complete a Bachelor of Commerce degree. Participation in the Co-operative Education Program typically necessitates an additional two terms to complete the Bachelor of Commerce degree.
 Students transferring to UBC from accredited co-operative programs at other institutions may request admission to the Sauder Co-operative Education Program and, if accepted, may receive co-op credit for one previously completed work term.

 Diploma Requirements
 The DAP curriculum consists of 15 courses, 45 credits in total, which cover the theoretical and practical knowledge and skills required to excel in a career in accounting and business. In addition, the program develops enabling competencies in critical thinking, analytical problem solving, communication, and technical skills necessary to be effective in an accounting role.
 The program requires the equivalent of 16 months’ full-time study and offers classes in variety of delivery formats: in-person evenings and weekend classes, online, and blended which combines both in-person and online components. Working students have the flexibility to take the program part time and have up to 24 months to complete their courses.
 Students can enrol in a maximum of 5 courses per winter term and 3 courses per summer term. Optional elective courses allow students to satisfy the specific requirements of the professional accounting designation programs.

 The Quantitative Methods (QM) Preparation Course
 The demanding nature of the Program requires that students have an adequate understanding of business statistics, quantitative decision-making methods, time value of money concepts, economic issues and decision-making, and business computing. For individuals who have not completed prior economic and statistics coursework, participation in the QM Preparation Course is recommended. It is also an option for individuals wanting to brush up on their skills and improve the ability to perform in an accounting or business decision-making context.
