The following rubrics apply to students enrolled in all required courses of a Vantage program. Progression rules may vary slightly for those who are enrolled in a Vantage Advising-approved reduced course load (e.g. students registered with the Centre for Accessibility, Varsity athletes). See Vantage Academic Advising for more information. Vantage One Arts Admission to the Vantage One Arts Program is suspended until further notice. UBC Vantage One Arts students who pass all courses with an average of at least 60% will be eligible for year two of the B.A. degree program. Students who do not successfully complete the full UBC Vantage One Arts program or who achieve an average lower than 60% in the full program will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, where there is evidence of academic promise for study in Arts. For more detailed information on the criteria used in these case-by-case decisions, please see vantagecollege.ubc.ca/progression-second-year Vantage One Engineering The Faculty of Applied Science delivers engineering programs at both UBC campuses: Okanagan and Vancouver. The Faculty has reserved space for all UBC Vantage One Engineering students to be able to transition to a second-year program. Half of the reserved spaces are located on the Okanagan campus, and the other half are located at the Vancouver campus. UBC Vantage One Engineering students who pass all courses with an average of at least 60% will be eligible for year two of the B.A.Sc. degree program. Program selection is competitive, and all students will be asked to rank both their preferred campus and their eligible program 1 . Academic performance at the end of the Winter Session and a personal statement are considered in placing students into programs in second year. Students who do not successfully complete the full UBC Vantage One Engineering program or who achieve an average lower than 60% in the full program can apply to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for evidence of academic promise for continued study in Engineering at UBC. Program Average and Course Success Program Standing Progression Status 60% or more overall average and successfully complete all courses Good Standing Progression to year 2 of the BASc in the Faculty Applied Science 60% or more overall average and 55% or more LLED* average with 1-2 failed courses.

Students may be granted promotion to year 2 of the BASc, OR granted continuation to year 1 of the BASc, and required to enroll in the English Foundation Program** Less than 60% overall average and fail one or more courses OR Fail or not complete 3 or more courses OR Less than 55% overall average OR Less than 55% average in LLED courses Required to Withdraw Required to Withdraw from UBC *LLED average comprised of LLED 200 and LLED 201 **Applies only to students placed at UBC Okanagan. Students with this outcome must complete EAP 104 during Winter term 1 of first year in Faculty of Applied Science. Students will be subject to a credit restriction during Winter term 1. See English Foundation Program or visit academic advising for more information. 1 Eligible programs include: Okanagan Campus: Civil, Electrical, Manufacturing, and Mechanical Engineering. Vancouver Campus: Biomedical, Chemical, Chemical and Biological, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Engineering Physics, Environmental, Geological, Integrated, Manufacturing, Materials, Mechanical, and Mining Engineering. Upon successful completion of the UBC Vantage One Engineering program, students will be eligible for second year standing. Additional program requirements (humanities elective or APSC 181, depending on program) that are normally completed in first year will not have been met and must also be completed prior to graduation. Students transferring into the second year of the Biomedical Engineering program who have not completed all required first year BME courses may be required to complete additional first year course work during second year. Vantage One Management Admission to the Vantage One Management Program is suspended until further notice. UBC Vantage One Management students who pass all courses with an average of at least 60% and who achieve at least 60% in WRDS 150 will be eligible for year two of the B.Mgt. degree program offered at UBC Okanagan. Students who do not successfully complete the full UBC Vantage One Management program or who do not meet progression requirements for year 1 will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, where there is evidence of academic promise for study in Management. For more detailed information on the criteria used in these case-by-case decisions, please see vantagecollege.ubc.ca/progression-second-year Vantage One Science UBC Vantage One Science students who pass all courses with an average of at least 60% will be eligible for year two of the B.Sc. degree program.

The College offers first-year programs for international students from a wide variety of school systems, and with different linguistic and cultural backgrounds, to have the opportunity to transition into the second year of a UBC degree program upon successful completion. The programs have been designed for international secondary school students who demonstrate a strong potential to succeed in university, but who may benefit from smaller class sizes and additional academic, language, and social supports. Students will form a cohort within the program that includes academic language preparation, additional academic support, and the completion of first-year coursework. Upon successful completion of an 11-month program, students will have completed a minimum of 24 credits of first-year coursework applicable to a degree program and are assessed for transition into the second year of study towards a UBC Bachelor’s degree in the Faculties of Arts, Science, Applied Science, and Management.

+
+Introduction
+
+Introduction
+
+The University of British Columbia has established UBC Vantage College on its Vancouver campus to offer programs that broaden the capacity of the University to attract and support outstanding international students.
+
+The College offers first-year programs for international students from a wide variety of school systems, and with different linguistic and cultural backgrounds, to have the opportunity to transition into the second year of a UBC degree program upon successful completion.
+
+The programs have been designed for international secondary school students who demonstrate a strong potential to succeed in university, but who may benefit from smaller class sizes and additional academic, language, and social supports. Students will form a cohort within the program that includes academic language preparation, additional academic support, and the completion of first-year coursework.
+
+Upon successful completion of an 11-month program, students will have completed a minimum of 24 credits of first-year coursework applicable to a degree program and are assessed for transition into the second year of study towards a UBC Bachelor’s degree in the Faculties of Arts, Science, Applied Science, and Management.

The educational objective of the B.S.W. curriculum is to provide students with the knowledge, values, and skills necessary for an initial level of professional practice focusing on the interface between personal problems and public issues. It addresses issues of power and issues of discrimination based on age, race, gender, sexual orientation, class, and culture. The program trains students in generalist social work practice and aims to provide competency in a wide variety of areas, including preparation to work in systems of any size. Critical thinking and structural analysis are, therefore, central to the learning experience offered by the School and to the promotion of social justice and human well-being. The Bachelor of Social Work degree is a single, integrated program that can be completed in two years on a full-time basis or in three years on a part-time basis. The curriculum includes courses on theory, policy, research, and practice.

+Bachelor of Social Work
+
+Introduction
+
+Introduction
+
+The School offers a Bachelor of Social Work degree that is accredited by the Canadian Association for Social Work Education (CASWE). The educational objective of the B.S.W. curriculum is to provide students with the knowledge, values, and skills necessary for an initial level of professional practice focusing on the interface between personal problems and public issues. It addresses issues of power and issues of discrimination based on age, race, gender, sexual orientation, class, and culture. The program trains students in generalist social work practice and aims to provide competency in a wide variety of areas, including preparation to work in systems of any size. Critical thinking and structural analysis are, therefore, central to the learning experience offered by the School and to the promotion of social justice and human well-being.
+
+The Bachelor of Social Work degree is a single, integrated program that can be completed in two years on a full-time basis or in three years on a part-time basis. The curriculum includes courses on theory, policy, research, and practice.

For information on advanced degrees, see graduate Microbiology and Immunology . The Department offers versatile major and honours specializations leading to the Bachelor of Science. All students take the same core courses but appropriate choices of selections allow students to develop foundations in diverse areas such as applied microbiology, environmental microbiology, immunology, microbial pathogenesis, microbial physiology, molecular genetics, virology, bioinformatics, computer science and oceanography. Eligible students entering second year wanting to apply to the Joint Degree Biotechnology Honours specialization and all students wanting to enter second year Microbiology and Immunology Major, Honours or second year Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology Major, Honours or Microbiology and Oceanography Major specializations must apply using the online process administered by the Faculty of Science. Eligible students finishing first year will receive an email communication regarding the process in late May or early June. Due to the similarity between the Major and Honours specializations in second year the Faculty of Science only admits students directly to the Major or the Combined Major. MICB 322 (Molecular Microbiology Laboratory) is a required course for the Microbiology and Immunology Major and Honour, and Combined Microbiology and Oceanography Major specializations. It is an elective course for students in the Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology Major and Honour specializations. The Department offers MICB 322 in term 1 of the Winter session and term 1 of the Summer session. All students entering third-year in good standing in the Microbiology and Immunology Major and Combined Microbiology and Oceanography Major specializations will be placed into MICB 322. Students are required to apply to the Department for placement in the Winter or Summer sessions of MICB 322. Students are given priority based on their academic performance. See here for details. Students interested in transferring into the Microbiology & Immunology specializations after year 2 can apply to the Department for a seat in MICB 322. Acceptance is contingent on space availability. See here for details. The applications will open in mid-April. See here for more information. Qualified students may apply to transfer to an Honours specialization in third year. Enrolment in any Microbiology and Immunology Honours specialization or combined Honours specialization, requires a sustained, annual academic average of at least 75% in second, third, and fourth year of these specializations. Co-operative Education Option This option integrates academic study with relevant supervised work experience. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between the students and the employing organizations. Enrolment is limited. Admission is by application to the Science Co-op Office in February prior to third year (late applicants may be considered if they contact the Life Sciences Co-op Coordinator). Selection will be based on previous academic performance and general suitability to the work environment as assessed by resumé and interview. Admissibility to a third-year Microbiology and Immunology Bachelor of Science specialization is prerequisite for admission to the Co-op Option but applicants can apply to Co-op before admission to the third-year microbiology specializations. Graduation from the Co-op program requires completion of four work terms, the normal courses required for the specialization. Detailed information is available from Microbiology and Immunology or the Co-operative Education Office .

Students with credit for BIOL 200 or sufficient credits of first year biology to enrol in BIOL 200 may skip BIOL 112 if they take an extra 3 credits of upper-level MICB courses in year 3 or 4. Students should be aware that BIOL 180 (or BIOL 140) is a prerequisite for many upper-level BIOL courses at UBC. To maintain flexibility in their ability to study at UBC, students should consider including BIOL 180 (or BIOL 140) in their first year at UBC even though this course is not required in this specialization. 2 Students who do not have BC high school Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100.

+Microbiology and Immunology
+
+The
+
+Department of Microbiology and Immunology
+
+offers opportunities for study leading to doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degrees. For information on advanced degrees, see graduate
+
+Microbiology and Immunology
+
+.
+
+The Department offers versatile major and honours specializations leading to the Bachelor of Science. All students take the same core courses but appropriate choices of selections allow students to develop foundations in diverse areas such as applied microbiology, environmental microbiology, immunology, microbial pathogenesis, microbial physiology, molecular genetics, virology, bioinformatics, computer science and oceanography. Eligible students entering second year wanting to apply to the Joint Degree Biotechnology Honours specialization and all students wanting to enter second year Microbiology and Immunology Major, Honours or second year Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology Major, Honours or Microbiology and Oceanography Major specializations must apply using the online process administered by the Faculty of Science. Eligible students finishing first year will receive an email communication regarding the process in late May or early June. Due to the similarity between the Major and Honours specializations in second year the Faculty of Science only admits students directly to the Major or the Combined Major.
+
+MICB 322 (Molecular Microbiology Laboratory) is a required course for the Microbiology and Immunology Major and Honour, and Combined Microbiology and Oceanography Major specializations. It is an elective course for students in the Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology Major and Honour specializations.
+
+The Department offers MICB 322 in term 1 of the Winter session and term 1 of the Summer session. All students entering third-year in good standing in the Microbiology and Immunology Major and Combined Microbiology and Oceanography Major specializations will be placed into MICB 322. Students are required to apply to the Department for placement in the Winter or Summer sessions of MICB 322. Students are given priority based on their academic performance. See
+
+here
+
+for details.
+
+Students interested in transferring into the Microbiology & Immunology specializations after year 2 can apply to the Department for a seat in MICB 322. Acceptance is contingent on space availability. See
+
+here
+
+for details.
+
+The applications will open in mid-April. See
+
+here
+
+for more information.
+
+Qualified students may apply to transfer to an Honours specialization in third year. Enrolment in any Microbiology and Immunology Honours specialization or combined Honours specialization, requires a sustained, annual academic average of at least 75% in second, third, and fourth year of these specializations.
+
+Co-operative Education Option
+
+This option integrates academic study with relevant supervised work experience. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between the students and the employing organizations. Enrolment is limited. Admission is by application to the Science Co-op Office in February prior to third year (late applicants may be considered if they contact the Life Sciences Co-op Coordinator). Selection will be based on previous academic performance and general suitability to the work environment as assessed by resumé and interview. Admissibility to a third-year Microbiology and Immunology Bachelor of Science specialization is prerequisite for admission to the Co-op Option but applicants can apply to Co-op before admission to the third-year microbiology specializations. Graduation from the Co-op program requires completion of four work terms, the normal courses required for the specialization. Detailed information is available from

It is possible to take (with appropriate prerequisites) some of MATH 307, 308, 312, 317, 340, and MATH/STAT 302 (as well as MATH 300) in the second year. Students interested in pursuing statistics to some depth should take STAT 200 and MATH/STAT 302 in the second year. This will prepare them for more advanced statistics courses such as STAT 305, 306, and 404. Major students should consider taking some of MATH 300, 320, 322. MATH 302 and MATH 307 are courses which are useful in many areas of mathematics. Students interested in operations research should take MATH 340, 441, 442, and 443. They are also advised to take MATH 303, STAT 305, and 306, and some advanced computer science courses. Students interested in teaching are advised to take MATH 308, 309, 312, 313, 414, 446. Students interested in becoming actuaries can make substantial progress toward this career goal while majoring in mathematics or statistics. These students should consult the actuarial advisors in the Mathematics and/or Statistics Departments for detailed advice on course selection and advice on taking the Society of Actuaries' exams. Students interested in the physical sciences should take MATH 317 which is important for MATH 300, 316. Students interested in economics should consider taking ECON 420 and 421, and should consult an advisor in the Vancouver School of Economics for other appropriate economics courses. A joint Major in Mathematics and Economics is available. See below. In selecting electives, students should consider pursuing an area of application of mathematics in some depth. They should also ensure that they fulfill all the graduation requirements of the Faculty of Science.

+
+Recommendations
+
+The Department makes the following recommendations:
+
+Mathematically able students are encouraged to take the honours stream MATH 120, 121, 223, 226, and 227.
+
+In second year, MATH 221 should be taken in Term 1. It is possible to take (with appropriate prerequisites) some of MATH 307, 308, 312, 317, 340, and MATH/STAT 302 (as well as MATH 300) in the second year.
+
+Students interested in pursuing statistics to some depth should take STAT 200 and MATH/STAT 302 in the second year. This will prepare them for more advanced statistics courses such as STAT 305, 306, and 404.
+
+Major students should consider taking some of MATH 300, 320, 322.
+
+MATH 302 and MATH 307 are courses which are useful in many areas of mathematics.
+
+Students interested in operations research should take MATH 340, 441, 442, and 443. They are also advised to take MATH 303, STAT 305, and 306, and some advanced computer science courses.
+
+Students interested in teaching are advised to take MATH 308, 309, 312, 313, 414, 446.
+
+Students interested in becoming actuaries can make substantial progress toward this career goal while majoring in mathematics or statistics. These students should consult the actuarial advisors in the Mathematics and/or Statistics Departments for detailed advice on course selection and advice on taking the Society of Actuaries' exams.
+
+Students interested in the physical sciences should take MATH 317 which is important for MATH 300, 316.
+
+Students interested in economics should consider taking ECON 420 and 421, and should consult an advisor in the Vancouver School of Economics for other appropriate economics courses. A joint Major in Mathematics and Economics is available. See below.
+
+In selecting electives, students should consider pursuing an area of application of mathematics in some depth. They should also ensure that they fulfill all the graduation requirements of the Faculty of Science.

The program provides specialized education for graduate students in the study of children's literature using a multi-disciplinary approach. The program is designed to provide each student with the opportunity to study the creative writing and publishing of this literature, examine models of sharing its rich heritage with the young, and also facilitate the literary, social, historic, and psychological analyses of children's literature as literature. This multi-disciplinary approach will expose students to many schools of literary criticism, educational theory, and professional and creative practice. It will acquaint students with the broad literary canon of children's literature across a spectrum of languages and cultures and with a variety of critical perspectives and professional applications. An undergraduate student considering working in the field of children's literature should consult the School about useful preparatory classes. An interview may be arranged at any time. Admission Requirements For admission to the M.A. program, a student must: hold a four-year bachelor's degree (or its equivalent) from a recognized university in a relevant discipline or in an area that is regarded as appropriate by the Admissions Committee for the program; have achieved a minimum overall average in the B+ range (76-79% at UBC) in third-and fourth-year level courses of a bachelor's degree; and show promise of success or superior accomplishment in one or more aspects of children's literature as attested by letters of reference and a personal letter of intent. An applicant holding a bachelor's degree or its academic equivalent who does not meet the requirements of the second requirement (above) should contact the School's Educational Services Coordinator for information regarding possible qualifying work. Program Requirements The M.A. is awarded on the completion of 30 credits of work, including 24 credits of coursework and a 6-credit thesis. The coursework will be selected in consultation with the supervisory committee to support the multi-disciplinary nature of the program. A maximum of 6 credits of coursework may be taken at the 300- or 400-level; the remainder must be at the 500-level and above. Of the 24 credits of coursework, 3 credits are required from each of the following categories, including at least 6 credits at the 500-level: Historical Overview (3 credits): LLED 441, ENGL 392, LIBR 520, 521 Contemporary Children's/Young Adult Literature (3 credits): LLED 442, 449, LIBR 520, 521, 526, LLED 540, 541 Research Methodology (3 credits): CHIL 500, EDUC 500, LIBR 507 The remaining 15 credits of courses may be chosen from the wide range of offerings available in the departments of English Language and Literatures, French, Hispanic and Italian Studies, Language and Literacy Education, the School of Creative Writing, and the School of Information; from relevant courses, with the Chair's approval, offered elsewhere at UBC; and from approved courses offered by other institutions. Subjects can also be pursued under Direct Readings. A maximum of 12 credits in courses germane to children's literature, earned no more than five years prior to entry into the program, may be transferred from another institution or another program at UBC. Transfer credit will not be accepted for a course that has been applied to another degree. The degree may be taken on a full-time or part-time basis. Students may begin the program in Winter Term One. Thesis: The supervisory committee will advise on, monitor, and evaluate the 6-credit thesis. Contact Information School of Information The Irving K.

+Master of Arts in Children's Literature
+
+Degrees Offered: M.A.
+
+Program Overview
+
+The School of Information, with the participation of the School of Creative Writing and the departments of English Language and Literatures and Language and Literacy Education, offers a multi-disciplinary Master of Arts program in Children's Literature. The program provides specialized education for graduate students in the study of children's literature using a multi-disciplinary approach. The program is designed to provide each student with the opportunity to study the creative writing and publishing of this literature, examine models of sharing its rich heritage with the young, and also facilitate the literary, social, historic, and psychological analyses of children's literature as literature. This multi-disciplinary approach will expose students to many schools of literary criticism, educational theory, and professional and creative practice. It will acquaint students with the broad literary canon of children's literature across a spectrum of languages and cultures and with a variety of critical perspectives and professional applications.
+
+An undergraduate student considering working in the field of children's literature should consult the School about useful preparatory classes. An interview may be arranged at any time.
+
+Admission Requirements
+
+For admission to the M.A. program, a student must:
+
+hold a four-year bachelor's degree (or its equivalent) from a recognized university in a relevant discipline or in an area that is regarded as appropriate by the Admissions Committee for the program;
+
+have achieved a minimum overall average in the B+ range (76-79% at UBC) in third-and fourth-year level courses of a bachelor's degree; and
+
+show promise of success or superior accomplishment in one or more aspects of children's literature as attested by letters of reference and a personal letter of intent.
+
+An applicant holding a bachelor's degree or its academic equivalent who does not meet the requirements of the second requirement (above) should contact the School's Educational Services Coordinator for information regarding possible qualifying work.
+
+Program Requirements
+
+The M.A. is awarded on the completion of 30 credits of work, including 24 credits of coursework and a 6-credit thesis. The coursework will be selected in consultation with the supervisory committee to support the multi-disciplinary nature of the program. A maximum of 6 credits of coursework may be taken at the 300- or 400-level; the remainder must be at the 500-level and above.
+
+Of the 24 credits of coursework, 3 credits are required from each of the following categories, including at least 6 credits at the 500-level:
+
+Historical Overview (3 credits): LLED 441, ENGL 392, LIBR 520, 521
+
+Contemporary Children's/Young Adult Literature (3 credits): LLED 442, 449, LIBR 520, 521, 526, LLED 540, 541
+
+Research Methodology (3 credits): CHIL 500, EDUC 500, LIBR 507
+
+The remaining 15 credits of courses may be chosen from the wide range of offerings available in the departments of English Language and Literatures, French, Hispanic and Italian Studies, Language and Literacy Education, the School of Creative Writing, and the School of Information; from relevant courses, with the Chair's approval, offered elsewhere at UBC; and from approved courses offered by other institutions. Subjects can also be pursued under Direct Readings.
+
+A maximum of 12 credits in courses germane to children's literature, earned no more than five years prior to entry into the program, may be transferred from another institution or another program at UBC. Transfer credit will not be accepted for a course that has been applied to another degree. The degree may be taken on a full-time or part-time basis. Students may begin the program in Winter Term One.
+
+Thesis: The supervisory committee will advise on, monitor, and evaluate the 6-credit thesis.
